The Iliad of Homer
Translated into English Prose
by E. H. Blakeney, M.A.
Vol. I containing Books I-XII. Vol. II containing Books
XIII-XXIV
A great improvement on Mr. T. A. Buckley's version, which has
hitherto represented the Iliad in "Bohn's Classical Library". The student
will find it a great help, and, to say the least, he will not be offended by
any banality in the English style. But the special excellence of the book
is, we think, to be found in the very instructive foot-notes. These will
often prove
valuable to those who are much beyond the average of those
who use translations.'-Spectator.
'A version of considerable literary merit, using the English of the
Authorised Version and Elizabethan writers generally. The whole
volume is, indeed, admirably calculated to give those who have no Greek
a view of Homer's supremacy in the world of letters.'-Notes and Queries.

PREFACE TO VOL. II
DR. JOHNSON once declared that the first merit of
a translation consisted in its being read with pleasure
by those who do not know the original. I should be
well satisfied if my version of the Iliad gave pleasure
to some few (not too exacting) readers; failing which,
I must console myself with the reflection that I have
got a good deal of harmless pleasure out of my self-
appointed task. At the same time I am conscious of
a disagreeable truth lurking in Denham's lines to
Sir R. Fanshaw:
Such is our pride, our folly, or our fate,
That few, but such as cannot write, translate.
Nor do I forget Dryden's words (in his Preface to
Ovid's Epistles): 'It seems to me that the true reason
why we have so few versions that are tolerable is
because there are so few that have all the talents
requisite for translation, and that there is so little
praise and small encouragement for so considerable
a part of learning.' Where many better men have
failed-and often failed dismally-I can hardly hope
to have secured more than a very slight modicum of
success. Translation, like politics, is a field where

action is apt to be one long second-best, and where
the choice constantly lies between two blunders. Yet
I have done what I could; the book, now brought to
a close after seven years' fairly continuous work, has
cost me a good deal of labour, not a little research,
and perhaps wasted a considerable amount of mid-
night oil. Critics, both the captious and the kindly,
will doubtless find plenty to censure; only those who
have essayed a similar task can fully appreciate the
difficulties inherent in such an attempt. To quote
Byron:
What is writ, is writ:
Would it were worthier!
In revising the proofs I have noticed how often
'heroic' lines crop up in the translation; many of
these I have successfully weeded out, but many still
remain. The fact is, the genius of the English
language is such that sentences have a tendency
to shape themselves naturally in blank-verse form.
Take any standard work in English prose, and again
and again you may find examples of this interesting
peculiarity.
Something, perhaps, ought to be said as to the
method adopted in making this version. It is simple
enough. I have tried to render the original with
the same kind of fidelity that characterizes the
narrative portions of the Authorized Version of the
Old Testament. These same narratives appear to me

the best possible model for a prose rendering of Homer.
If it be objected that to write in seventeenth-century
English at this time of day savours of archaism, I
should reply that this sort of archaism is legitimate
because it precisely suits the style of the Greek Epic,
which is itself archaistic without preciosity, old-
fashioned though without affectation.
At this whoever envies or repines,
I leave him to his lot-and like my own.
Since the publication of my first volume, several
important books have appeared either directly dealing
with Homer, or bearing indirectly on Homeric
problems, notably the second edition of Prof. Gilbert
Murray's Rise of the Greek Epic (1911); the same
writer's Four Stages in Greek Religion (1912); Andrew
Lang's World of Homer (1910); Mr. Shewan's Dolo-
neia (1911); and Mr. Chadwick's The Heroic Age
(1912). The last-mentioned writer tabulates the
hypotheses which have been brought forward to
explain the origin of events and characters in Homer,
thus: (1) Tribal Myths (these he regards as based on
unsubstantial foundations); (2) Fiction; (3) Trans-
ference; (4) Tribal Heroes. The fourth is the
popular theory just now. In any case, it is worthy
of remark that Thucydides, who was probably able to
form quite as good a judgement as we are, never
disputes the historical basis of the Homeric Epos.

PREFACE TO VOL. II
One might add that tradition has a curious habit of
justifying itself before the bar of history. Readers of
the Old Testament (pace Dr. Cheyne and his School)
have good reason to know this.
How much the matter of the Northern heroic
literature resembles the Homeric may be felt at every
turn; compare, for instance, the Battle of Maldon
with any similar battle-scene in the Iliad. Again,
the style of Beowulf, as Prof. Courthope reminds us
(in vol. i of his History of English Literature), is an
exact reproduction of the Homeric style.
Homer opens up so large and intricate a field for
archæological discussion¹ that it would be impossible,
in a book like this, to do more than indicate, with the
utmost brevity, a few of the more salient features of
interest. In the footnotes to the translation I have
occasionally tried to draw attention to some of these
points. Curious readers will be able, with the aid of the
references given, to follow up some at least of the clues.
1 Let me give one single example. In Homer the gods are provided
with sacred enclosures (teµévŋ) and open-air altars (ẞwμoí), but com-
paratively few shrines (vŋoí). True, Athena has a vŋós in Troy (Iliad
vi. 88) and at Athens (ii. 549); while Apollo has one in Troy (v. 445)
and at Chrusê (i. 32). Are we then to assume, from these and other
somewhat sparing references, that 'temples' were, on the whole,
a late addition to the apparatus of Hellenic worship? Dr. Percy
Gardiner (Gardiner and Jevons's Greek Antiquities) appears to regard
any such assumption as unjustified. Prof. Murray, on the other hand
(Rise of the Greek Epic2, p. 184), remarks that it is clear that during
the greater part of the Iliad and the Odyssey worship is carried on at
High Places or altars in the open air. Quis iudicabit?

Occasionally repetitions will be found in the course
of these notes. I do not think it necessary to
apologize for this: bis repetita docent. The notes are
not for scholars, but for the 'general reader,' as he is
called.
I should be grateful if any one who detects errors
in text or comment would be good enough to commu-
nicate with me. If ever this work should reach
a second edition (a somewhat improbable contingency),
those errors would, so far as possible, be corrected.
And now, in taking final leave of a book which has
occupied my thoughts so long, shall I be deemed
unduly fanciful if, writing here beneath the shadow
of the Alhambra, I seem to discover some point of
contact as well as of contrast between two cities so
remote from each other, alike in place and date, as
Granada and Troy? The visible splendour of the one
has long since departed, and nothing but a few melan-
choly fragments survive of what was at once mart, and
castle, and queen-city; nevertheless Troy, though dis-
crowned, lives for ever, because Homer has enshrined
the legend both of her glory and her tragedy in
imperishable epic. Of the Moorish palace and strong-
hold enough still remains to yield us more than
transitory glimpses of a beauty and romance un-
surpassed, perhaps, in the world's annals; yet how
little we know of the inner life that beat once so

bravely behind these sunlit walls for nigh upon half
a millennium! And the inevitable hour must at length
come when the story of Boabdil and his princely pre-
decessors will appear but a dim thing, faintly (if at all)
remembered; for no poet has arisen, like Homer, to
vitalize that lovely and alluring past of which tower,
and court, and crumbling walls are, to-day, the silent
and solitary witnesses. A thought trite enough, no
doubt, yet old and perpetual as Time.
But already the westering sun warns me to close.
Amid the soft sound of running waters, glittering gaily
in their channels, comes the music of a nightingale
from some unseen pleasaunce-a music mingled with
the fragrance of orange trees, and of roses that cluster
bright by arch and broken parapet; beyond the roofs
of the dear decrepit town at my feet stretches the
Vega into purple distance; while far away, and leagues
to the south, glow the snows of the Sierra.

suit of its quarry.
99-106. The flying Trojans compared to hinds driven by
wild beasts of the forest.

like a boulder dislodged from a hill but finally
brought to rest on the level plain.
178-181. The fall of Imbrios compared to that of a mountain
oak hewed down by the woodman.
198-202. The bearing away of the dead Imbrios by the
Aiantes compared to the bearing away of a goat
by a pair of lions.
241-245. Idomeneus, hurrying to the rescue, is likened to a
flash of lightning wielded by Zeus from Olumpos.
298-305. Meriones and Idomeneus, a dread pair of warriors,
are compared to the god Ares and his son óẞos
(Rout), empanoplied for battle.
334-337. The conflict between the Trojans and the Greek
champions is compared to the meeting of two
rolling dust-clouds.
389-392. The fall of huge Asios is figured by that of some
lofty tree, hewn by shipwrights on a hill-side.
470-477. Idomeneus abides the coming of Aineias, as a wild
boar awaits the hunters and their dogs.
491-495. Aineias leads his people, as a ram leads the flocks
to a water-course.
570-573. The death-struggle of Adamas is compared to that
of a young bull lassoed by herdsmen.
588-592. The glancing of an arrow from the armour of
Menelaos is compared to dry pods tossed away

through fallow ground.

XIII. 795-801. The Trojan onset is figured by the sudden rush of
a thunder-storm sweeping over land and ocean.
XIV. 16-21. The mind of Nestor wavers between two designs,
like a sea swelling idly till the wind falls upon
it and determines its motion.
XV.
286-291.
Sleep, perched in a tree, is likened to a night-owl.
393-401. The noise of encountering hosts compared with
(1) the noise of billows thundering upon a beach;

wind among trees.
414-418. Hektor, stricken to the dust by a stone, is figured
by an oak uprooted by the bolt of Zeus.
80-83. Hera, speeding from Ida to Olumpos, is likened,
for swiftness, to the wistful thought of a traveller.
(Once only in the Iliad,' says Jebb, 'have we
a simile from the action of the waking mind.')
168-172. Iris flies, swift as hail through an icy air, to convey
the bidding of Zeus.
236-238. Apollo descends from Ida, rapid as a falcon upon
his prey.

a child destroys a sand house which he has built
on the sea-shore.
382-384. The Trojans pour in over the Greek wall like waves
over a vessel's side.
410-413. An even-balanced fight is compared to a piece of
timber levelled by the shipwright's rule.
579-589. A double simile: in the first part Antilochos,
rushing upon Melanippos, is likened to a dog
flying upon a grounded fawn; in the second,
Antilochos, hurrying to avoid Hektor, is likened
to a wild beast which, after slaying its prey,
flees from pursuit.
605, 606. Hektor rages, like the god Ares, or a fire con-
suming the bracken on some hill-side.
617-638. A succession of similes. Hektor's assault upon
the Greeks is first compared to the sea flung
back in foam from some rock; then to the rush
of a wave upon a storm-tossed vessel; next
to a lion leaping upon a herd of cattle, all of
which, save the doomed victim, scatter and flee.

Aias, striding over the ships' decks, is like a circus-
rider leaping deftly from steed to steed.
Achilles chides Patroklos for weeping like a
little child running beside her mother, and look-
ing up tearfully till taken into the mother's
arms.

gathering of wolves, after slaying a stag, beside
some water-hole, there to glut their thirst.
211-214. The dense masses of the Murmidons are like
a close-compacted wall.
259-267. The Murmidons issue forth from their ships like
fierce wasps disturbed by wanton children.
297-302. The sudden deliverance of the Greeks from the
Trojans is compared to the outbreak of light
through dispersing clouds.
352-357. The Greek chieftains attack the Trojans as wolves
attack a flock of unguarded sheep.
364-366. The Trojans are driven from the ships like mist
from a mountain.
384-393. The Trojans rush off in mad affright; this is com-
pared to the confused din of a flooded mountain
torrent plunging seaward.
406-409. Patroklos drags Thestor from his chariot as a fisher-
man hauls out a fish from the sea.
428-430. Sarpedon and Patroklos dash upon each other with
loud screams, like two gier-eagles.
482-491. A double simile. Sarpedon's death is compared
(1) to the fall of a tree beneath the woodman's
axe; (2) to the fall of a bull before a lion's
onslaught.
582, 583. Patroklos rushes forward like a falcon scaring
a flock of birds.
589-592. The Trojans give ground before the Greeks, about
a javelin's cast.
633-644. The noise of combatants over Sarpedon's body is
compared to the noise made by woodcutters in

XVII. 53-69. The fall of Euphorbos is compared to that of an
olive-tree smitten by a sudden wind, or an ox
torn by some fierce lion.
106-113. Menelaos retreats before Hektor, like a lion pur-
sued by dogs and hunters.
132–137. Aias, shielding the body of Patroklos, is compared
to a lion guarding its cubs.
263-266. The uproar of the Trojan charge is likened to the
roar of the sea in an estuary.
281-285. Aias breaks the Trojan squares as a wild boar
scatters a hunting party.
389-395. The struggle for Patroklos's body by the conflicting
hosts is figured by the tugging of a bull's-hide
by a number of workmen in the process of
curing it.
434-437. The horses of Achilles, in their grief for Patroklos,
remain motionless as a pillar set on a tomb.
520-523. Aretos falls like an ox beneath the blow of a pole-
axe.
547-552. Athena is veiled in a dark mist, as the rainbow is
projected on a background of purple cloud.
569-573. The boldness infused by Athena into Menelaos is
compared with the boldness, or pertinacity
(θάρσος), of a fly.
656-666. Menelaos reluctantly gives way, as a spent lion
retreats before the continual assaults of dogs and
men.
673-681. Menelaos looks for Antilochos, keen-eyed as an
eagle in search of prey.
722-759. A succession of images. As the body of Patroklos
is carried away by the Aiantes, the Trojans
charge them as hounds charge a wounded boar,
only to retreat before the onslaught of the
maddened brute. The onslaught of the Trojans
is next compared with a fire breaking out suddenly
in a crowded city; on the other hand the bearers
are compared with patient mules dragging
a baulk along a mountain path; and Aias, who
keeps the host at bay, to a rock that diverts
a stream. Finally, the assaults of Aineias and
Hektor upon the Greeks are likened to the
attack of a kite on a crowd of daws.
XVIII. 161-164. Hektor undaunted as a lion whom shepherds
cannot drive off.
205-214. A comparison between the radiance flashing from
the head of Achilles and the beacon-flame which

midst of a beleaguered city.
XVIII. 219–221. The shout of Achilles over the trench compared

of a lion that, returning to its lair, finds its cubs
taken.
599-601. The circle of the dance likened to a potter's
wheel.
XIX. 349-351. The descent of Athena from heaven is like that of
an eagle.

himself to fury against the foe.
403-406. The death-roar of Hippodamas is like that of a bull
before the altar.
490-499. A double simile. Achilles is first compared with
a fire raging in a forest; secondly, his horses, as
they tread down the slain, are likened to steers
treading out the corn.
12-16. The Trojans are driven into the river like locusts.
22-26. The Trojans cower before Achilles as fish flee

North-wind in autumn dries a vineyard.

cauldron.
493-496. Artemis flees from Hera, like a dove chased by
a kite.
522-525. The sorrow wrought by Achilles upon the Trojans
is likened to the smoke rising from a doomed
city.
573-580. Agenor's courage likened to that of a panther
when facing its pursuers.
21-32. Priam, from the walls of Troy, sees Achilles
rushing in pursuit of Hektor, his armour flashing
like Orion's dog that brings fever to mortals.

The armour of Achilles, now close upon Hektor,
flames like fire or the rising sun. Achilles
swoops upon his foe as a falcon upon the
dove.
157-166. The race round the city, of pursuer and pursued,
is figured by that of horses in a chariot contest.
189-201. The pursuit continued. Hektor is likened to
a fawn followed by a hound. This comparison
is followed by a simile from a dream in which
the dreamer cannot outpace the one who runs
before him.
308-311. Hektor draws his sword and rushes upon Achilles,
as an eagle upon a fawn.
317-320. The brandished spear of Achilles is likened to the
evening star in splendour.
XXIII. 222-225. The weeping of Achilles for Patroklos is compared
with that of a father mourning for his son.
XXIV.
431-433. Antilochos passes ahead of Menelaos' far as a quoit
may reach.'
517-522. Menelaos is close upon Antilochos, far as the
chariot wheel is behind the horse's tail.
596-600. The anger of Menelaos melts like dew.
692-694. Eurualos knocked off his feet like a fish flung upon
the shore by a strong wind.
711-713. The attitude of two wrestlers compared to house-
rafters leaning towards each other.
759-763. Odusseus follows his rival close as a woman holds
a shuttle to her breast.
844-847. Polupoites hurls the iron lump far as a herdsman
flings his crook.
41-44. The ruthlessness of Achilles likened to that of
a lion.
77-82. Iris plunges into the sea, swift as a fishing line
weighted with lead.
480-483.
Achilles beholds Priam reverently, as though the
old man were a blood-stained fugitive from
a foreign country.
(Note that, among animals, the lion is remarkable as furnishing no
less than 30 similes in the Iliad; these are taken from wellnigh every
moment in a lion's life. Next to the lion-similes come those of the boar.)

BOOK XIII
THE DEEDS OF IDOMENEUS'.
While Zeus had turned his eyes awhile from the Trojan plain,
Poseidon, beholding, from the peak of Samothrace, the rampart forced
by Hektor, takes the shape of Kalchas, and inspires the Greeks to
martial valour. The Trojan onset is stayed; and many deeds of valour
are done. Idomeneus of Crete displays surpassing courage, but retires
before Aineias and Deïphobos. After mighty efforts on both sides, the
Trojans are repulsed on the left; but Hektor still holds his ground
against the Aiantes. At length a Council of War is held, at the
bidding of Pouludamas. Hektor also consents, but first rallies his
men. He upbraids Paris, whom he finds bearing the brunt of battle.
The two brothers hurry to the centre, and Hektor is challenged by
Aias.
SCENE: Between the Greek wall and the sea-shore.
Now when Zeus had brought the Trojans and Hektor
to the ships, he suffered the combatants there to have
labour and distress without pause; but he himself
averted his shining eyes, gazing afar over the land of
the horse-loving Thracians, and the Musoi that delight
in war, and the haughty Hippomolgoi that live on mares'
milk, and the Abioi, most just of men'. But toward

Troy he turned no more his shining eyes; for no
thought was in his heart that any Immortal would come
to help either Trojan or Danaan.
10.] Yet did not the Earth-shaker keep blind watch;
for he sate, marvelling at the war and battle, high upon
the topmost peak of wooded Samothrakê¹; for from
thence all Idalay visible, all visible too the city of Priam
and the Achaian ships. There, coming from the deep,
had he sate him down; and he pitied the Achaians
smitten by the Trojans, and fierce was his anger against
Zeus.
17.] Straightway from the rugged mountain he
descended, with swift strides; the high hills and forest
quaked beneath the deathless feet of Poseidon as he
came. Three strides he took 3, and with the fourth he
reached his goal, Aigai*; there, in the depths of the sea,
is his glorious dwelling, wrought all of glittering gold,
immortal ever. Thither came he; and beneath his
chariot yoke made ready two brazen-hooved steeds,
swift of flight, their golden manes a-wave; and with his
follow the ancient custom, in their love of 'koumiss.' And Marco
Polo notes this practice in his Travels (chap. xlvii).
1 'To the South was Tenedos ; and here, at my side, was Imbros...
but aloft above Imbros, aloft in a far-away heaven was Samothrace,
the watch-tower of Neptune. So Homer had appointed it, and so it
was' (Kinglake, Eothen). Lewin, Life and Epistles of St. Paul,
i. 200, notes this passage in Homer as a remarkable instance of the
poet's geographical accuracy.

the majestic in literature.
An early example of the notion of walking in 'seven leagued
boots.'
Aigai, in Euboia, was specially connected with Poseidon's
worship; Anth. Pal. ix. 90:-

rose up sea-beasts, that sported by reason of his coming,
and knew their lord; for very rapture the sea parted
asunder¹; and swiftly flew the steeds, nor was the
brazen axle wet beneath. Him did the steeds, lightly
leaping, bear to the Achaian ships.
32.] There is a wide cavern in the depths of the
deep sea, midway between Tenedos and rugged Imbros;
there did Poseidon, that shaketh the earth, halt his
steeds, and loose them from the chariot; and beside
them he cast immortal food to eat. About their feet he
fastened golden tethers, such as could not be broken
nor untied, to the end that they might surely abide here
their lord's return; but he himself went to the Achaian
camp.

or tempest, were following Hektor, Priam's son, with
frenzied eagerness, joining in noise and battle-cry".

And loosed the reins. Across the waves he flew
Lightly, within his sea-blue car. Down sink
The billows; 'neath the thunder of his wheels
The swelling floods are laid; the stormy clouds
Melt through the vast of air.

Strange shapes on either hand, sea-monsters dire,
Tritons, and Nereids.'

They thought to seize the Achaian ships, and to slay
all the bravest warriors beside them. But Poseidon,
that encompasseth the land and maketh the earth to
shake, was spurring on the Argives, soon as he had come
forth from the deep, putting on the likeness of Kalchas
in body and unweariable voice. First spake he unto
the two Aiantes, themselves also eager for the fray :-
'Ye two Aiantes, be it yours to save the host of
Achaia, mindful of your valour, and not of chilling
flight. Elsewhere ¹, I dread not the invincible hands of
the Trojans, who, in their multitudes, have overpassed
the mighty wall; for the well-greaved Achaians will
keep them at bay; but here, of a truth, terribly do I fear
for them lest we suffer aught, here where that madman
doth, like a flame of fire, lead them-even Hektor who
vaunteth himself to be son of almighty Zeus. Now
may some god put it into your minds both yourselves to
stand fast and to command the rest; so might ye force
him back, for all his eagerness, from the swift-going
ships, aye, even if the Olympian sire himself is rousing
him to battle.'
2
58.] So spake the god that compasseth the land and
maketh the earth to shake; with his wand he smote
the twain and filled them with lusty might; their limbs
he made light, their feet, and their hands above. Like
a swift-winged hawk, which, soaring aloft from a steep
precipitous rock, sweepeth in pursuit of some bird' across
the plain even so did Poseidon himself, who shaketh
¹i.e. anywhere but in the place where Hektor is now fighting.

the earth, pass swiftly from the heroes. Of the twain,
swift Aias, Ofleus' son, first perceived the god; and
straightway spake unto the son of Telamon:-
'Aias, verily it is one of the gods that dwell upon
Olumpos, who, in prophet guise, biddeth us do battle
by the ships, not Kalchas, the seer, that interpreteth
bird-omens; for easily did I mark the motions' of his
feet behind, and of his legs, as he passed away; truly
the gods be readily discerned! Moreover, my spirit
yearneth the more to do battle and to fight, and eager
feet beneath and my hands above.'
76.] Then did Telamonian Aias make answer unto
him, saying:
are my
'Even so now for me also my irresistible hands play
eagerly about my spear; my might is arisen; beneath,
my feet bear me nimbly away. Yea, I burn to do
battle, even unaided, with Hektor, son of Priam, in his
insatiate passion.'
81.] Thus spake they to each other, exulting in the
glow of battle which the god had set within their hearts.
Meanwhile, he that compasseth earth urged back to the
fray those Achaians who, beside the swift ships, were
resting awhile. By reason of grievous toil their limbs
were slackened, and anguish fell upon them while they
beheld the Trojans, who, in their multitudes, had crossed
their mighty wall. And as they looked upon them, they
wept sore, for they deemed not they would escape from
the evil. But the earth-shaker, moving easily to their
midst, heartened the sturdy ranks. To Teukros came
he first, with word of bidding; then to Leïtos and war-
like Peneleos, to Thoas and Deïpuros and Meriones

and Antilochos, counsellors of battle. Unto these he
spake winged words, cheering them on :-
'Shame upon you, Argives,―boys, not men ¹! to you
I look to save the ships, an ye but fight. Howbeit if
ye shall let loose your hold on distressful war, know
that even now the hour is come for you to be subdued
beneath the Trojans. Ah, well-a-day! a great marvel
is this that I behold, a dreadful thing, the which I never
thought to see accomplished,-our ships attacked by
Trojans, who, heretofore, were like panic-stricken deer,
wandering strengthless and alone through the forest,
the prey of jackals and pards and wolves; nor is there
any spirit in them. Even so the Trojans in time past
would not face the might and hands of the Achaians,
nay, no whit. But now, far away from the city, beside
our hollow ships they fight, through the fault of our
leader and the lukewarmness of our people, that, wrath
with him, will not fend the foe from their swift-journey-
ing ships, but let themselves be slain-among them³.

III.] Yet even if the hero son of Atreus, wide-ruling
Agamemnon, is ever so truly at fault, in that he hath
dishonoured Peleus' swift son, yet must not we sur-
cease from war. Nay, the sooner let us heal the breach";

for you, bravest in all the host, ye do not well to abate
your warrior-might any longer; nor would I quarrel
with a man who, a sorry wight, should surcease from
war; yet with you am I wroth even with my whole
heart. Ye cowards! belike, by reason of this slackness,
ye will achieve some greater mischief; notwithstanding,
bethink you, each one, of shame and of dishonour¹; for
behold there is a mighty broil arisen. Hektor, a valiant
warrior, doeth battle by the ships undaunted; and hath
broken the gates and the long bar.'
125.] With such exhortations did he that compasseth
the land urge the Achaians. Round about the two
Aiantes stood the unyielding ranks, which even Ares'
self, had he come into their midst, would never have
scorned, nor Athena that urgeth men to battle; there
stood the doughtiest, picked warriors, awaiting the
Trojans and godlike Hektor, spear close-joined with
spear, shield with overlapping' shield; targe pressed
hard on targe, helm on helm, warrior on warrior";
while, as they bent their heads, their horse-plumed
helms touched with bright crests': so close stood they
together. Their spears, brandished by dauntless hands,
bent to the strain; ever their thought was to go onward,
and they yearned for battle.

136.] But the Trojans swept forward in close masses;
straight on did Hektor lead them, with eager zeal, like
a boulder from the rock, which some torrent, swoln
with winter rains, thrusteth from the hill-top, breaking
away with resistless rain its hold in the monstrous rock;
bounding on high, it flieth, and all the forest rever-
berates beneath; lo, in unbroken course, it runneth
unswervingly until it reacheth the level; then, for all its
swiftness, no more it rolleth: so Hektor, the while,
threateneth he will force his way with ease through
tents and ships of the Achaians, slaughtering as he
goeth'. But when at last he met those solid ranks, close
upon them he halted. And Achaia's sons, full fronting
him, thrust at him with swords and two-handed spears,
and drave him from them; backward he yielded,
staggering. Then with shrill cry, he called upon the
Trojans :

Dardans, bide your ground; no long time will the
Achaians stay me, albeit they have ranged themselves
firm as a tower. Nay, methinks, they shall give beneath

'As headlong from a mountain pinnacle
Plunges some rock, by tempests torn away,
Or washed by angry rains, or loosed by years
Slow-lapsing; lo, the monstrous crag, swept sheer
With huge impulsion, leaps along the ground,
Involving in its ruin herds, and men,
And forest-trees; so Turnus, through that rout
Of warriors, rushed toward the city wall.'

spirit of each warrior. Among them strode Deiphobos,
Priam's son; his heart beat high; before him he held.
his well-balanced shield; lightly stepped he forth,
beneath the cover of his shield'. But Meriones lunged
at him with shining spear, and struck, nor missed his
aim, full upon the well-poised shield of bull's hide. Yet
the long spear pierced it not, but brake off first at the
shaft-head. And Deïphobos kept the bull's hide shield
at arm's length from him, greatly fearing the spear of
stout-hearted Meriones. Then did the hero give way,
retreating back among his comrades, sore vexed by
reason of his defeat, and of the spear which brake.
He hied him to the tents and ships of the Achaians,
in quest of the long lance which had been left within
his tent.
169.] But the rest fought on, and noise unquenchable
arose. First Teukros son of Telamon slew a man,
Imbrios the spearman, son of Mentor rich in steeds.
Now he dwelt in Pedaios, ere the coming of the
Achaians, and his wife was a daughter of Priam, a love-
child, Medesicaste. But when the rounded galleys of
the Danaoi came, back unto Ilion went he, and was
famous among the Trojans, and dwelt in the palace of
Priam, who honoured him as one of his own sons.
Him did the son of Telamon pierce beneath the ear
with his long lance, and drew it out; and the man fell

summit of a hill visible all round from far, boweth its
tender leaves to the ground: so fell he, and his harness,
inwrought with bronze, clanged above him. Then
forth sprang Teukros, eager to spoil him of his armour;
but, as he sprang, Hektor aimed at him with shining
spear. Howbeit, when Teukros beheld, he shunned
the brazen spear by a little space; but Hektor struck
with his spear upon the breast of Amphimachos, son of
Kteatos whose sire was Aktor, as battleward he stept.
With loud crash he fell, and his harness rang above
him.
188.] Then did Hektor leap forth, to reave from the
head of high-hearted Amphimachos the helm that
clasped his temples; but Aias with his shining spear
made thrust at Hektor as he leapt; howbeit the flesh
nowhere showed¹, for all was covered about with bronze
terrific; yet he pierced the boss of the shield, and
backward thrust him with mighty strength; and Hektor
gave way from both the dead, while the Achaians
dragged them forth. Stichios and godlike Menestheus,
princes of the Athenians, carried Amphimachos to the
Achaian host; and the two Aiantes, eager for fierce
battle, bare Imbrios away.

Oïleus' son strake off the head, wroth for Amphilochos;
then, wheeling round, sped it, like a ball, through the
press; and it lay in the dust before Hektor's feet'.
206.] And now indeed was Poseidon mightily enraged,
by reason of his grandson's death in the dire conflict;
and he moved beside the ships and tents of the Achaians,
urging on the Danaoi; but for the Trojans was he
contriving bale. Now it was so that there met him
Idomeneus, spear-famous hero, harking from a comrade
(whom he had found but newly gone from the war)
wounded behind the knee with the sharp bronze. Him
his companions carried; and Idomeneus, after that he
had charged the physicians, was going unto his tent;
for he was eager to meet the fray. Then did the
lord, that shaketh earth, hail him, having made his
voice like unto the voice of Thoas, Andraimon's son,
who was king among the Aitolians in all the country of
Pleuron and Kaludon; and he was reverenced as a god
among the people :-
'Idomeneus, thou that counselleth the Kretans, where
now be those threats, wherewith Achaia's sons did
threaten the Trojans?'
And Idomeneus, leader of the Kretans, answered on
this wise :-
'Thoas, no man is to blame this day, so far as I
know; for we all know how to do battle. Neither
coward fear layeth hold on any, nor doth any man,
giving way to dread, shirk evil war; but so, I trow, it
is the will of almighty Zeus that the Achaians should.

been regarded as the mark of a barbarian-emphasized the revengeful
feelings of the Greeks against one who had married a half-sister of

perish here, inglorious, far from Argos. But O Thoas,
--for thou wert aforetime steadfast, aye and thou canst
urge another on, whensoever thou beholdest him giving
way, cease thou not now, but lay thy bidding on every
wight.'
231.] Then spake Poseidon, the earth-shaker, in
answer:-
'Idomeneus, let not that man return home any more
from Troy, but become here the sport of dogs, who,
this day, doth willingly shrink from the fray. Nay, go
to, seize thine arms and follow me; needs must we
hasten this business together, if peradventure, though
we be but two, we may prove of any avail. Consorted
valour counteth for much, yea, even of sorry fighters¹;
but we twain could quit us even against the valiant.'
239.] So spake the god; then plunged again into
the thick of combat. But when at length Idomeneus
was come to his well-builded tent, he arrayed him in
goodly armour, and chose two spears; then went he
forth like the lightning which Kronos' son taketh in
his hand and brandisheth from shining Olumpos, show-
ing to mortals a sign; conspicuous shine its beams afar :
even so upon his breast blazed out the gleam of bronze
as he ran. And it was so that Meriones, his brave
henchman, met him while he was still near the tent;
for he was coming in quest of a bronze spear; and
thus did stout Idomeneus accost him :

'Meriones, son of Molos, swift of foot, beloved friend,
wherefore comest thou, leaving war and battle? Art
thou wounded, and doth the edge of some weapon vex
thee, or hast thou come bearing some message unto me?
Verily, no wish have I to sit idle in the tent, but to
fight.'
Then wise Meriones made answer :-
'I am come to fetch a spear, if haply any is left in
thy tent; for that I had aforetime have I broken, what
time I struck the shield of overweening Deiphobos.'
259.] Then did Idomeneus, prince of the Kretans,
reply :-
'Nay, spears, if thou wilt, thou wilt find enow stand-
ing in the tent facing the sunny porch,-Trojan spears,
which I am wont to take from the slain. No mind have
I to stand afar from my foes, and do battle. Wherefore
have I spears, and bossy shields, and helms, and breast-
plates brightly glinting.'
266.] And wise Meriones thus answered :-
'I, too, have many Trojan spoils in my tent and black
ship; but they be too far off to fetch. For I, methinks,
like thee, have not forgotten my martial prowess, but in
battle that bringeth men renown I stand among the
foremost, whensoever the strife of war ariseth. Maybe
some other of the mailed Achaians marketh me not
when I fight; but thou knowest ¹.'

these things? For if, this day, all our bravest should
be chosen for an ambush, where men's valour is dis.

now this hue, and now that, nor is his heart within him

cowereth, shifting from foot to foot, and loud beateth his
heart within his breast, foreboding diverse deaths, while

not, nor feareth he overmuch, once he hath taken his

no man would cast a slur on thy might, thy bravery.
For wert thou struck amid the stress of battle, by spear

took up swiftly from the tent a bronze spear, and started
in quest of Idomeneus, right eager for war. As when
Ares, bane of men, hieth him to war, companied by
Rout, his well-beloved son, a mighty and a dauntless

Then Meriones spake first :-

throng? Upon the right of all the host, or in the midst,
or upon the left? Since nowhere else, methinks, are

answer on this wise :-
'In the ships' midst there be others to made defence,-

Achaians, goodly too at the hand-to-hand; these, spite
of all his eagerness, will chase Hektor, son of Priam,
till he be sated of battle, right doughty though he is.
Hard will it be for him, for all his zest in the combat, to
vanquish their might and resistless hands, and fire the
ships, unless the son of Kronos himself should cast
a blazing bolt against the swift ships. But Aias,
Telamon's huge son, would never yield to man,-man

And Ambush, henchmen of the War-God, whirl :
So, thro' the battle-midst, swift Turnus drave
His smoking steeds, and trampled down the dead.'

even to Achilles, slayer of men, would he give place, at
least in standing fight; howbeit, in swiftness of foot
none may contend with Achilles. But as for us¹, bear
thou to the left of the host, as we are doing, that with
all speed we may be certified whether we shall give
glory to another, or some one give glory to us.'
So spake he; and Meriones, swift Ares' peer, drave
onward, until they came unto the host, by the road he
bade him 2.
330.] Now when the men of Troy beheld Idomeneus,
like unto a flame in strength, himself and his henchman,
clad in richly wrought mail, they called to one another
throughout the host and all bare up against the hero;
and the strife waxed general at the galley-sterns. As
when, driven by shrilling winds, swiftly rush the blasts
on a day when plenteous dust is upon the thoroughfares;
lo, the winds lift up, in one, a huge cloud: so shocked
those combatants in war; and eager were they to slay
one another amid the throng with sharp bronze³. And
the deadly battle shuddered with long spears, that tare
the flesh; and their eyes were blinded with the bronze
gleam from shining helms, and hauberks newly-burnished,
and glittering shields, as onward came they together.
Right bold of heart were he that could joy to behold
the combat, nor be dismayed.

with diverse aims, contriving bitter pangs for warrior
heroes. Zeus was purposing victory for the Trojans.
and Hektor, to do honour to swift-footed Achilles';
nor was he fain that Achaia's folk should perish utterly
before Ilion; nay, rather, he would honour Thetis and
her strong-souled son. But Poseidon was rousing the
Argives, by coming into their midst as he rose stealthily
from the hoary sea; for he was wroth to see them
smitten by the Trojans, and his anger was kindled
against Zeus. In sooth the twain were of one lineage,
and of one parentage; notwithstanding Zeus was elder
born, and shrewder far. Wherefore Poseidon shrank
from open succour, but ever stirred the host in secret,
in fashion as a man. So the two gods knotted the cord
of stubborn strife and of equal-balanced war over both
sides, and drew it taut ³,—a rope that none might break,
nor loose, unstringing the knees of many.

that he had called to the Danaoi, sprang upon the
Trojans and turned them to flight. For he slew Othruo-

but lately had he come, hearing the fame of the war,
and sought to wife Kassandre, loveliest of the daughters
of Priam; nor asked a dower, but promised a mighty

deed, to drive the Achaians from Troy, whether they
would or no. To him the aged Priam made promise,
and vowed to give her; and so he fought, trusting the
king's word. But Idomeneus wounded him with
glittering spear, and smote him, as haughtily he stept;
nor did the bronze mail he wore save him, but deep in
his belly sank the spear'. With a loud clash he fell;
and his enemy exulted aloud:
'Ha, Othruoneus, I praise thee, yea above all mortals,
if indeed thou shalt fulfil the covenant thou madest with
Priam, son of Dardanos, for the which he promised
thee his daughter! And we, too, would fain make
promise, and fulfil the same, and give the loveliest of
Atrides' daughters to be thy wife-yea, fetch her from
Argos-if, with us, thou wilt sack Troy's well-built
citadel. Nay follow, that by the ocean-going ships we
may strike a bargain touching thy marriage, since of a
truth we be no niggard covenanters '.'
383.] With such words the hero Idomeneus dragged
him by the foot through the fierce combat; and Asios
came to rescue the dead, on foot before his steeds;
these, breathing above his shoulders, were guided
ever by the charioteer, his henchman. Now he yearned
within him to smite Idomeneus; but that hero was too

swift, and struck him with a spear in the throat, beneath
the chin, and drove the bronze quite through. And he
fell as when some oak falleth, poplar, or lofty pine,
which, upon the hills, with axes newly-whetted, ship-
wrights hew for timber: so he, outstretched before
chariot and steeds, lay bellowing, clutching the gory
dust. Then was the charioteer bereft of the wits he
had aforetime, nor had he courage to turn his horses
back, and elude the foemen's hands. Him did Antilochos,
staunch warrior, pierce through the middle with his
spear; nought availed the bronze corselet that he wore;
deep in his belly sank the shaft. Gasping, he fell from

near to Idomeneus, and launched a shining spear. But
Idomeneus caught sight thereof and shunned the bronze
spear; for he hid beneath the round shield he bore,
ringed with ox-hides and flashing bronze, whereto were
fastened two stout rings¹; beneath that covert crouched
he; and the bronze spear flew over; while, as the
spear its surface grazed, harshy rang the buckler. Not
in vain did the shaft leave his heavy hand, but struck
Hupsenor, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the folk, in
the liver hard beneath the midriff; and straightway his
knees were loosed. And Deïphobos, with a loud cry,
exulted fiercely :-

I have given him an escort.'
417.] Thus he spake, and the Argives were pained
by reason of his vaunt; but chiefly was the heart of
Antilochos stirred within him; howbeit, spite his grief,
he was not unmindful of his comrade¹, but ran, and
stood above him, and covered him with his shield.
Then two trusty comrades took him up, Mekisteus son
of Echios and goodly Alastor, and bare him, groaning
deeply, to the hollow ships.
But Idomeneus slackened not in his fierce anger, but
was ever eager either to hide some Trojan in gloomy
night, or himself to fall, fending destruction from the
Achaians. Thereupon he slew the son of heaven-born
Aisuêtes, the hero Alkathöos; son-in-law was he of
Anchises, and had espoused the eldest of his daughters,
Hippodameia, dearly loved of her sire and honoured
mother in their palace; for she surpassed all of her
age in beauty, work, and wit; therefore it was that the
noblest man in wide Troy had married her. This was
the man Poseidon now struck down beneath the spear
of Idomeneus; his bright eyes he bewitched, and bound
his radiant limbs; he could not flee, nor shun the blow,
but, while immovable he stood like some pillar or
skyward-foliaged tree, the hero Idomeneus wounded
him with his spear full in the breast, and tare the
bronzen coat of mail which, aforetime, kept death at
bay. Then, I ween, hard clanged the harness, rent all

about by the spear; and, with a clash, he fell, the spear
fast-fixed in his heart¹.
445.] Then Idomeneus, with a loud cry, exulted
fiercely :-
'Say, Deiphobos, may we reckon that the slaying of
three for one is at all a fair set-off? seeing thou boastest
after this wise, lo, I will match thy boast! Nay, sirrah,
do thou thyself stand up and face me, that thou mayest
know what manner of man I am that be come hither—
true scion of Zeus, who first begat Minos to be ruler
over Krete. And Minos begat a blameless son, Deuka-
lion; and Deukalion begat me, lord of many men in
broad Krete; and now have my galleys brought me
here, to be an evil unto thee, and to thy sire, and to
the other Trojans.'
455.] He spake; and Deïphobos halted between two
opinions, whether to retreat and take some high-hearted
Trojan as his comrade, or to make the venture alone.
And, as he thought upon these things, he deemed it the
better course to hie in quest of Aineias. Him he found
standing idle on the margin of the throng; for ever was
his resentment hot against godlike Priam, because he
honoured him not, for all his prowess among men.
Then stood he hard by, and uttered winged words :-
1 Here follow two lines which smack of the interpolator :-

and thereupon mighty Ares let go the fury (of the spear),' i. e. allowed
it to rest.

where Achilles taunts him as a pretender to the kingship, and he in reply
sets forth his lineage; ib. 303-8, the succession is promised to him and
his posterity: "the race of Priam is rejected; henceforth Aineias and
his children's children shall reign among the Trojans "' (Warr).

'Aineias, counsellor of the Trojans, needs must thou
help thy brother' this day, if grief in any wise toucheth
thine heart. Come, follow me; let us succour Alkathöos,
who is thy brother, and erstwhile reared thee, while yet
a child, in his own home; verily, him hath spear-famed
Idomeneus slain.'
469.] Thus spake Deïphobos, and stirred up the spirit
within him; and Aineias started in quest of Idomeneus,
right eager for the fray. Notwithstanding, Idomeneus
fled not, as a stripling might, but stood his ground as
when a wild-boar upon the hills, trusting in his might,
abideth the huge oncoming rout of hunters in some lone
place; lo, he bristleth his back, and his eyes are ablaze
with fire; anon he whetteth his tusks, eager to beat
back both dogs and men²: even so did spear-famed
Idomeneus abide the onslaught of Aineias, swift to the
battle-cry, nor gave his ground. Loud cried he to
his comrades, as he beheld them-Askalaphos, and
Aphareus, Deïpuros, and Meriones, and Antilochos,
counsellors of battle. Them he urged on, hailing them
with winged words :-
481.] This way, friends, and help me, for I stand
alone; terribly do I fear Aineias who cometh against
me, swift of foot; aye, he cometh against me, for right
valiant is he to slay men in battle; the pride of youth
is his, and very great is his strength.
Yet were we
matched in age, and in this mood, swiftly should he win
great glory as his meed, or I as mine ³.'
487.] So spake he, and all with one consent stood

eldest sister).

other side Aineias cried aloud unto his comrades, as he
beheld DeŸphobos and Paris and godlike Agenor, that,
with him, led on the Trojans; next after these followed
the people, as sheep follow a ram from the pasturage
unto the water-brooks; and the shepherd rejoiceth in
his heart¹: even so Aineias rejoiced to behold the folk
following his lead.
496.] Then over the body of Alkathoos they leaped
to close conflict with long shafts; and upon their breasts
terrific rang the bronze, as they shot at one another in
the turmoil. And beyond the rest two mighty warriors,
Aineias and Idomeneus, peers of Ares, thirsted to
hack each other's flesh with pitiless bronze. Aineias,
first of all his band, cast at Idomeneus; but he saw and
shunned the bronzen spear, and the point thereof went
past, quivering down to the ground; for idly sped it
from his stout hand. Next Idomeneus smote Oinomaos
in mid belly, and burst the breastplate's hollow, so that
by reason of the bronze his bowels gushed out; prone
in the dust he fell, clutching the earth. Then from his
corse Idomeneus drew the long-shafted lance, yet could
he not draw from the shoulders the fair harness; so
beset was he with spears. For no longer were the
joints of his feet so sure that, by a swift rush, he could
leap upon his foe' or yet spring aside; wherefore, in
the place where he was, he fended from him pitiless fate;
but his feet bare him no longer nimbly that he should

escape by flight. Now, while he was moving off with
stealthy step, Deïphobos launched a shining spear; for,
ere now, he nourished an abiding wrath ever within him.
Howbeit, that time also he missed the foe, but struck with
his spear Askalaphos, son of Enualios. Right through
the shoulder the ponderous spear held on its way; and,
falling prone in the dust, he clutched the earth.
521.] Now it was so that loud-voiced mighty Ares wist
not as yet that his son had fallen in the fierce combat,
but upon the height of Olumpos beneath golden clouds he
sate, prisoned by the counsel of Zeus, in the place where
the other immortal gods did bide, barred from the war.
Then over the body of Alkathöos the fighters rushed
to close combat. Deïphobos reft from Askalaphos his
shining casque; but Meriones, swift Ares' peer, leapt
upon him, and with a spear struck his arm, while from
his hand the visored¹ helm fell with a hollow sound to
earth. Again Meriones upsprang, like a vulture, and
drew the mighty spear from his arm, close by the
shoulder, and withdrew to his comrades' midst. But
Polites, his own brother, casting his arms about his
middle, drew Deïphobos from the ill-sounding battle,
till he reached the swift horses which stood behind the
fray and war, along with the charioteer and fair-wrought
car; these bare him to the city, deeply groaning, for sore
was his pain; and the blood ran down from his late-
wounded arm.

able arose.
Then did Aineias dart forward, and strike

and round him was shed destroying death.

fell Thöon, both arms outstretched to his loved com-
rades.
550.] And Antilochos leaped forth, and began to
strip the harness from his shoulders, gazing round
meantime; but the Trojans, standing round about, kept
striking his broad all-glinting targe, now here, now there;
yet could they not with ruthless bronze graze the tender
flesh of Antilochos; for Poseidon, the earth-shaker,
rescued the son of Nestor even amid that hail of darts.
Albeit never clear of foemen, yet was he busy in their
midst; never was his spear at rest, but, brandished ever,
moved through a circle; and his heart's desire was
either to make one thrust, or rush out to close in
conflict.
560.] But, while he moved through the host aiming
his spear, Adamas, son of Asios, marked him, and,
rushing close to him, smote him in mid shield with the
sharp bronze; but blue-haired¹ Poseidon, grudging it
the hero's life, dulled the point's force. Though half
the spear, like some charred stake, was fast fixed in
the shield of Antilochos, the other half thereof fell to
earth; and back among his comrades drew Adamas,

shunning death; but Meriones followed hard after him
as he went, and struck him with his spear between groin
and navel, where the fortune of war proves most
merciless to hapless mortals. There planted he his
spear; but Adamas, yielding' to the stroke, plunged
like an ox which herdsmen have bound upon the hills
with osier-bands, and lead away,-unwilling captive²:
so Adamas, thrust through by the shaft, struggled but
a little space-not long-till valiant Meriones drew nigh
and wrenched the spear from his flesh. Then darkness
covered his eyes.
576.] Next Helenos, with huge Thracian sword,
smote Deïpuros at close quarters upon the temple, and
dashed away his helm; this, cast far off, dropt to the
ground, and one of the Achaians gathered it up as it
rolled among the feet of the warriors; but as for
Deïpuros, dark night covered his eyes.
581.] Then did anguish lay hold upon the son of
Atreus, Menelaos, that brave fighter; forth strode he,
after bitter threats against Helenos, the hero prince,
brandishing the while a sharp spear; and Helenos made
ready his bow. Then, at the selfsame moment, the
twain prepared themselves, the one to launch his pointed
spear, the other an arrow from the string. Straightway
the son of Priam struck with his arrow the hollow of
the corselet upon the breast; but the biting shaft leapt
aside. As upon some wide threshing-floor swart beans

wind and thresher's stroke: even so, glancing far from
the cuirass of glorious Menelaos, leapt aside that biting
shaft¹. But the son of Atreus, Menelaos, that brave
warrior, struck at his hand as it grasped the bow; and
the bronze spear pierced the hand, and was fixed fast in
the bow. Back among his comrades he drew, shunning
death, with his hand drooping at his side; and after him
trailed the ashen spear. And high-hearted Agenor
wrenched it from his hand, and bound it up with a twist
of wool 2.
· 601.] And Peisandros made straight against renowned
Menelaos; but him an evil destiny was leading to
death's bourn, to be slain by thee, Menelaos, in dread-
ful strife. Now it was so, when they were nigh each
other, that the son of Atreus missed, and his spear
was turned aside, while Peisandros thrust at the spear
of renowned Menelaos; yet could he not force the bronze
quite through; for the broad shield hindered the spear,
and it knapped asunder at the shaft-head. Whereat
he was glad at heart, and hoped for victory.
610.] Then the son of Atreus drew his silver-studded
sword, and flew upon Peisandros; and Peisandros got
out from under his goodly targe an axe, wrought cun-
ningly in bronze 5, set upon a haft of olive-wood, long
and richly polished; and at the same instant they fell

upon each other. Now of a truth Peisandros smote the
ridge of the horse-plumed helm at the edge, close beneath
the very crest; while the other smote Peisandros, as he
came on, in the brow above the bridge of the nose; and
the bones brake with a crash, and his two eyes fell
down, all bloody, in the dust at his feet; and he bowed
him together and fell. Then did Menelaos stand with
his foot upon his chest, and spoiled him of his harness;
and vauntingly thus he spake :
620.] 'Even so¹ will ye leave, I trow, the ships of
the swift-horsed Danaoi, ye haughty Trojans, insatiate ²
of dreadful strife! No lack have ye shown of shameful
insult, wherewith ye have insulted me, ye base curs;
nor have ye trembled before the fierce anger of thunder-
ing Zeus, the god of strangers, who will some day lay
low your lofty city,-ye that wantonly took my wedded
wife and plenteous gear beside, and made off with her,
guests in her house! And now are ye purposing to
cast deadly fire among our ocean-going craft, and to slay
Achaian heroes. But, methinks, ye will be stayed, spite
all your desire after war.
O Father Zeus, verily men say that thou surpassest
the wit of all, gods and men alike; and yet, behold, it is
from thy hands that all these things come! In proof
whereof, even now thou doest the will of violent men,
even these Trojans, whose heart is presumptuous ever,
nor can they glut themselves with the din of equal-
balanced war. Of all things there is surfeit, of sleep,

against the sacred laws of hospitality, laws sanctioned by Zeus ¿eivios
himself.

and of friendship, of melting song, and of faultless dance,
wherewith any man is fain to delight himself rather
than with war; but the Trojans are insatiate of battle.'
640.] With such words blameless Menelaos stript
from the body the arms, all bloody as they were, and
handed them to his comrades, while he himself went
back again to mingle with the foremost. Thereupon.
Harpalion, son of Pulaimenes the king, leaped upon
him; he had followed his loved father to Troy, to take
part in the war, yet returned he not again to his father-
land. Lo, in that hour he drew nigh and struck with
his spear the shield of Menelaos, full in the midst; but
could not drive the bronze through; back among his
comrades moved he, shunning death, glancing the while
this way and that lest any should touch his flesh with
the bronze. But, as he went, Meriones launched a
bronze-tipped arrow at him, and struck him upon the
right hip; and the arrow pierced the bladder, passing
beneath the pelvis bone. There, huddled together, he
lay like a worm stretched upon the ground, breathing
out his life among his loved friends: and the black gore
ran adown, bedewing the earth. Then did the high-
hearted Paphlagones gather round about him, and set
him upon a chariot and brought him unto sacred Ilion,
sore at heart; and with them went his father ¹, shedding
tears; but blood-wite for his dead son had he none.

he was his friend among many Paphlagones; wherefore
in his wrath he let go a bronze-headed arrow. Now
there was a certain Euchenor, son of the seer Polueidos,
a rich man and a brave¹, who dwelt in Korinth; and he,
albeit he foreknew his deadly doom, embarked on his
ship. For oft-times would his aged father, brave
Polueidos, tell him he would die of a cruel sickness
in his own home, or else be slain by the Trojans among
Achaia's ships. Wherefore he avoided the grievous
penalty laid upon him by the Achaians 2, and the loathed
sickness, to the end he might not sorrow in heart. This
man Paris smote beneath jaw and ear; and swiftly
did life forsake his limbs, and hateful darkness seized
him.

But Hektor, beloved of Zeus, knew not in any wise.
that, to the left of the ships, his people were being
smitten by the Argives; (so that anon victory would
have fallen to the Achaians; so valiantly was the

person besides); but onward drave he, where at the
first he had leapt through gates and rampart, after that
he had broken the serried ranks of Danaan shieldmen,
where the ships of Aias and of Protesilaus were drawn
up, on the hoar sea strand; and, above them, the wall
was builded lowest, for that here chiefly men and steeds
pressed to the fray.

flowing robes, Lokroi, and Phthioi, and bright-harnessed
Epeioi, could scarce hold back flame-swift Hektor, the
divine, from his onset against the ships, nor could they
thrust him from them. First there were the Iaones,
chosen men of Athens-among these Menestheus was
leader, son of Peteos, and with him followed Pheidas
and Stichios and Bias the brave, then the Epeioi
shepherded by Phuleides and Meges, Amphion and
Drakios; and, in front of the Phthioi, were Medon and
Podarkes staunch in battle. Now Medon was bastard
son of godlike Oïleus, and brother of Aias; his home
was in Phulake, far from his fatherland, because he had
slain a man, kinsman of his step-dame Eriopis, whom
Oïleus had to wife; and Podarkes was son of Iphiklos,
the son of Phulakos. These twain, clad all in mail,
stood on guard at the ships, in front of the high-hearted

Epic, pp. 172 sqq.) Leaf asserts that the epithet λexitoves is
'a national epitheton ornans,' as Ionian soldiers could never have
worn, in war, a dress which was 'incompatible with active exercise.'
Those who have fought in modern times against Dervishes and
similar tribes might fairly question the latter part of the remark.

side, the two warriors stood fast by each other. And
many brave peoples followed the son of Telamon as
comrades in arms, who took from his hands the shield
whensoever weariness and sweat came over his limbs.
But the Lokroi followed not after the great-hearted son
of Oïleus, for their courage failed them in the close
combat. No brazen helmets, horse-plumed, had they,
nor round targes, nor ashen spears; but to Ilion they
followed him, as thou knowest, trusting in their bows
and slings of twisted flock, wherewith they would oft-
times shoot and break the serried Trojan ranks. That
day, I ween, were those in front, clad in rich-wrought
harness, doing battle against the Trojans and Hektor
of the bronzen helm; while the Lokroi behind were
casting forth their shafts, unmarked; and no longer did
the Trojans remember the joy of battle, for the arrows
were utterly confounding them.
723.] Then would the Trojans have retired from
ships and tents, discomfited, to windy Ilion, had not
Pouludamas drawn nigh unto bold Hektor and spoken
on this wise¹:-
'Hektor, intractable art thou, nor wilt thou heed
persuasion; because God hath granted thee prowess
in war, therefore thou art minded to surpass others in
counsel too. Yet, methinks, thou wilt not be able of
thyself to accomplish all things; for while to one man

speech itself is obscure; and the simile in l. 754 is inappropriate, and
unlike the Iliad.

wisdom doth best discern the truth thereof. But I shall
tell thee as it seemeth best unto me.
736.] Behold, everywhere around thee flameth the
ring of war; and the high-hearted Trojans, now they
have passed over the rampart, stand-some of them-
aloof, mail-clad though they be; while some are fighting
at odds, few against many, scattered among the ships.
Then draw thou back, and summon hither all thy
doughtiest. After that we may well review all our
counsel, whether to fall upon the many-benched ships-
if haply God be minded to grant us victory-or else¹
withdraw from the ships while yet unscathed. For of
a truth I fear lest the Achaians make good the debt of
yesterday, seeing that beside the ships there bideth
a man insatiable of war, one who, methinks, will no
longer hold off utterly from battle.'
747-] So spake Pouludamas, and his shrewd words
pleased Hektor. Straightway from his chariot leapt he
to earth, with all his armour on; and he opened his
mouth and uttered winged words :-
'Pouludamas, do thou keep back here all the bravest
warriors, while I go yonder and face the encounter.
Swiftly shall I come again, when I have instructed
them well.'

He ended, and sped forth like unto a snowy hill',
with a loud cry, and rushed through the midst of Trojans
and allies. And they all hasted to the son of Panthos 2,
kindly-souled Pouludamas, when they heard Hektor's
voice. But Hektor moved among the champions, in
quest of Deïphobos, and the might of Helenos the
prince, and Adamas son of Asios, and Asios son of
Hurtakos, if haply he might find them. Them he found
no longer free from sorrow nor death; but some lay
dead beneath the stroke of the Argives, hard by the
poops, and some were within the walls of Troy, stricken
and wounded. But as for Paris, spouse of fair-tressed
Helen, him he found upon the left of the tearful battle,
heartening his comrades, and urging them to fight on.
Then, standing by his side, he spake unto him with
reproachful words :-
'Curst Paris, noble to look upon, full of guile, thou

774.] Then did Alexandros, godlike in form, make
answer :-

brother. Onward they strode where the fury of battle
waxed hottest, around Kebriones and blameless Poulu-
damas, Phalkes and Orthaios and godlike Poluphetes,
and Palmûs and Askanios and Morûs, Hippotion's son,
who hailed from Askanie, to replace their fellows the
previous morn; and now did Zeus urge them to the
fray. On rushed they, like the blast of fierce tempests,
which, urged by the thunder of Father Zeus, sweepeth
plainward, and mingleth with the mighty deep in con-
fused roar; and in the midst thereof riseth many
a blustering wave of the loud-sounding sea, arched, with
foam upon their crests, some before, some after even

glittering in their mail, followed their chieftains‘.

802.] Hektor, son of Priam, match of destroying
Ares, led the van; before him he held an equal-balanced
shield, stiff with bull's hide, heavy with beaten bronze;
and round about his temples shook a gleaming helm.
And all around made he trial of the ranks, stepping
forth foot by foot, if haply, as he moved forward beneath
cover of the targe, they would yield; howbeit he
dismayed not the spirit of the Argives. Then did Aias,
striding with huge steps, first sound a challenge:-
Draw near, my lord; wherefore seekest thou but to
fright the Argives? Well know we, methinks, how to
do battle; nay, but we Achaians were quelled by the
dour scourge of Zeus. No doubt thy heart hopeth to
spoil our ships; yet know thou¹ that we too have hands
to defend them. Verily, ere ye destroy our ships, your
own well-builded city is like to be taken and ravaged—
by us! I tell thee that the time draweth nigh when, in
headlong flight, thou shalt pray to Father Zeus and the
other Immortals, that thy fair-maned steeds may be
swifter than kites, to speed across the plain and bear
thee to the city.'
821.] Now, as he spake these words, there lighted at
his right hand a bird, even a high-flying eagle; and all
the Achaian host, heartened by the omen, shouted aloud.
But glorious Hektor returned his challenge
:-
observation of nature is close and natural. There are two points of
comparison, says Mr. Green (Similes of Homer): (1) the furious
vehemence of the charge, (2) the closeness of the ranks. These are
grandly imaged in these lines, the sound of which admirably echoes
the sense.
1 apap generally taken as meaning straightway; but the word here
means (says Leaf) little more than 'verily.'

fulfilment when Hektor was pursued by Achilles in that last flight in
front of the walls of Troy (Book xxii).

'Aias, thou graceless braggart', churl that thou art,
what words be these! O that I were assured that I were
all my days the son of aegis-bearing Zeus, with queenly
Hera for my mother, and honoured as Athena is
honoured, and Apollo, as sure I am that this same day
bringeth evil unto the Argives, one and all! and in the
midst of them shalt thou be slain, an thou dare bide my
long spear, which of a truth shall bite that fair tender
flesh of thine. Nay, thou shalt glut the dogs and birds
of Troy with thy fat and with thy flesh, fallen by the
Achaian ships.'
He spake, and led the way; and his comrades followed
him with loud cries, and the people shouted in the rear.
And, on the other side, the Argives shouted, nor forgat
their strength, but awaited the onslaught of the Trojan
chivalry. And the clamour of both armies rose up to
heaven, and to the bright rays of Zeus³.

3 A significant expression. The 'bright rays' are those of the
god of brightness, Dyaus (Zeus): see Max Müller, Chips from a
German Workshop (vol. iv. of the last ed., pp. 368 foll.). As the
Scholiast notes, by the 'rays of Zeus' the poet means the sky. But
observe that, though the supreme deity of the Greeks was essentially
the god of the bright sky, the notion was extended at a very early
date so as to cover that of Zeus as a weather god in general. As
Theocritus says:

THE BEGUILING of Zeus.
Nestor, who is sitting at meat with Machaon, hearing the noise of
conflict, hastens to find Agamemnon. He meets the prince, accom-
panied by Odusseus and Diomed; whereupon all three, spite of their
wounds, sally out to put spirit into their hosts. The god Poseidon
encourages the Greeks. At this moment Hera forms a plan to
beguile Zeus; and, the better so to do, secures the magic girdle of
Aphrodite. Next she obtains the aid of the Sleep-god, whom, after
some parley, she persuades to lull Zeus to sleep upon Mt. Ida. On
learning this, Poseidon urges the Greeks to a final effort. Hektor,
meeting with Aias, is wounded, and carried from the field.
The
Trojans are driven back across the rampart.
SCENE: as in Book xiii.
Yet did not the battle-cry¹ escape Nestor, though busy
with his cups 2; but he spake winged words unto the
son of Asklepios :-
'Mark thou, goodly Machaon, what the end of this
business will be³. Louder, I trow, groweth the noise of
stalwart warriors by the ships. Do thou sit here, quaffing
bright wine, till fair-tressed Hekamede heat thee the
laver, and thou wash away the stains of blood; but I
will go swiftly and hasten to a place of outlook".'

So saying, he seized his son's well-wrought targe, that
lay in the tent, even the shield of horse-taming Thra-
sumedes, all shining with bronze; but Thrasumedes had
his father's shield. And Nestor grasped a sturdy spear,
tipped with sharp bronze, and stood without the tent,
and quickly beheld a dismal sight, these driven in rout,
and those forcing them from the rear-even the high-
hearted Trojans; and the Achaian wall had been cast
down.
As when a mighty sea heaveth because of the sullen
swell, boding the rapid courses of shrill winds, idly as
yet, rolling neither forward nor back, till some decisive
breeze cometh down from heaven': so pondered the
old man, his mind divided betwixt two things—whether
to go in quest of the swift-horsed Danaoi, or of Aga-
memnon son of Atreus, shepherd of the folk. And while
he mused, thus it seemed the better course-to go after
the son of Atreus. For the warriors were slaughtering
one another in battle, and the unwearying bronze clashed
about their flesh, as they stabbed one another with
swords and twin-pointed spears.

been wounded, met Nestor, as they were returning from

'sullen') it falleth to land among the seaweed.' In 1. 17 bσσóμevov,
'foreboding,' is a rare thought; for Homer hardly ever attributes
any sort of feeling to inanimate nature. This touch of the 'pathetic
fallacy' is almost modern.

the ships, to wit, the son of Tudeus, and Odusseus,
and Agamemnon, Atreus' son. Far away from the
fight had their ships been drawn up, by the margent of
the hoary sea; for these ships they had drawn up first
to shore, but the wall they had built next the outermost ¹.
For the beach, wide though it was, could not hold all
the ships, and the people were pressed for room;
therefore had they drawn them up, rank behind rank2,
and filled the great bay of all the shore betwixt the
enclosing headlands. And now the chieftains, lusting
for the battle-cry, came on in close order, leaning upon
their spears; and their hearts were sore vexed within
their breasts. The aged Nestor met them, and he
smote the hearts of the Achaians with dismay.*
40.] And kingly Agamemnon opened his mouth and
spake :-
'O Nestor, son of Neleus, thou great glory of Achaia,
what meaneth it that thou hast forsaken the deadly war
and comest hither? I fear lest dauntless Hektor ac-
complish the word that he uttered aforetime among the
Trojans, when he sware that he would in no wise go
back from the ships to Ilion, or ever he had burned
those ships with fire, and had slain us. Thus he
spake; and now, behold, all these things will be
fulfilled. Out upon it! in very sooth the other well-

52.] Then answered him Nestor, Gerene's knight :-
'Verily these threats have been by now wrought out;
nor could high-thundering Zeus himself ordain them
otherwise. For the wall is broken down, which we
trusted should be an impregnable defence alike for
selves and ships; while the Trojans by the swift ships
ever keep up unabating battle; nor couldst thou tell,
for all thy zealous search, from which side the Achaians
are being driven in headlong rout; so confused is the
slaughter, and the cry of them goeth up to heaven. But
let us take counsel what our course shall be, if wisdom
is like to accomplish aught. I counsel not that we
enter the war; for a stricken man may in no wise.

'Nestor, seeing that they are warring at the sterns,
and neither rampart nor moat have availed aught, over
the which the Danaoi toiled abundantly, inly trusting
they would prove an impregnable defence alike for
selves and ships, I trow it must be the pleasure of Zeus
almighty that the Achaians should perish here, far from
Argos, unpitied. I knew it aforetime, when Zeus was
with all his heart aiding the Danaoi; I know it now,
when he doth exalt the Trojans as though they were
blessed gods, but bindeth our might and hands. But

night. Better for a man to escape peril by flight, than

Odusseus addressed :-
'Son of Atreus, what word is this that hath passed
thy lips? Thou sorry wight, I would thou hadst been
ruler of some other host—and that a pitiful one—and
no king over us, to whom Zeus hath granted, from early
youth even to old age, to wind up grievous wars, till we
fall each one ³. Is it thus that thou thinkest to leave
wide-streeted Troy, for the which we suffer many an evil
thing? Hold thy peace, lest some Achaian hear this
word, which no man would utter that knew in his heart
how to speak in season-and he a bearer of the sceptre,

answer to him :—
'Odusseus, thou hast strangely moved me with thy
grievous reproach; howbeit, I bid not Achaia's sons
drag the well-benched galleys seaward against their
will. Now therefore, in the present case, let some one,
young or old, offer better counsel; gladly would I
welcome it.'
109.] Next spake Diomed, that gallant warrior' :-
'The man is nigh-we shall not long be at fault-if
ye will hearken each one, and bear no angry grudge
because I am the youngest among you. But I also
boast myself son of a noble sire, even Tudeus, whom

Come, let us go unto the war, wounded though we

obeyed; then moved they on, and Agamemnon, king
of men,
led the way.

watch, but overtook them in guise of an aged man,
and took the right hand of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,
and opened his mouth, speaking winged words :—

147.] At these words he uttered a loud shout, as he
bounded over the plain. Loud as the cry of nine
thousand or of ten thousand men in war, when they
meet in deadly strife, so loud the cry that issued from
the breast of the mighty Earth-shaker; and great
strength he put into the heart of the Achaians, each
one, to war and fight unceasingly.
153.] And, behold, Hera of the golden throne stood
and looked out of Olumpos from a peak'; and straight-
way she was ware of him, her brother alike by birth
and wedlock, as he moved swiftly through the glorious
fray; and her heart was glad; and Zeus she descried
sitting upon the topmost crag of many-fountained Ida;
and she hated him. Then did Hera, bright-eyed queen,
bethink her how she might beguile the mind of aegis-
bearing Zeus; and this device seemed best-to deck
herself featly and go to Ida, if perchance her lord might
yearn to sleep in love beside her, and that she might
shed abroad upon his eyes and shrewd wits a balmy
sleep, driving away care. Then went she up into her
chamber, which her own son Hephaistos had wrought,

heart because I help the Danaoi, but thou the Trojans?'
Then answered Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus :-
'Hera, thou queen of heaven, daughter of mighty
Zeus, say what thou wilt; my mind urgeth me to do
this thing, if so be I can do it, and if it may be done'.'
197.] Then did Hera, crafty of counsel, make
reply:-
'Grant me this hour love and desire, wherewith thou
dost subdue all unto thyself, mortals and Immortals
alike. For I shall go hence to behold the bounds of
all-fruitful Earth, and Okeanos parent of gods, and
Mother Tethûs, who reared me lovingly in their home
and fostered me, when they took me from Rheia, in the
day that far-seeing Zeus cast Kronos beneath the earth
and barren sea. Them shall I visit, and loose their

'Father Eternal, Thine is to decree,
Mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will

Cf. too Seneca, Herc. Oet. 272 :—
'Quid cessas, dea?

Ocean was the first to marry, and he espoused his sister Tethys, who
was his mother's daughter.' The conception of an earth-surrounding
Ocean-stream, as an origin (yéveσis) of all things, may be Semitic in
source. This line was often quoted, with a perverse use of allegory,
by later writers; Clement of Alexandria went so far as to suggest
that 1. 205 (the withdrawal of Okeanos and Tethus from each other)
means the separation of sea and land; just as he holds that Homer,
when he makes Apollo ask Achilles (xxii. 8) 'why fruitlessly pursue
him, a god?' means to imply that deity cannot be apprehended by
the bodily faculties: Hatch, Hibbert Lectures for 1888 (chap. iii).

severed from mutual love and friendship, seeing that
anger hath fallen heavy upon them. If, by persuasive
words, I might set them again in each other's arms,
then should I ever be called both dear and honoured by
them.'
211.] Then answered laughter-loving Aphrodite :-
:-
'Nay, it is not even seemly to refuse thy request; for
thou sleepest in the embrace of the mighty Zeus.' She
spake, and from her bosom loosed the magic¹ band,
richly dight; within it were hid all manner of sweet
charms that soothe,-love, and desire, and seductive
dalliance, which deceiveth the wit even of the steadfast-
minded "."
And she laid it in Hera's hands, and spake unto her
on this wise:-
'There, take and hide this band within thy bosom,-
the broidered band, wherein is hid thy heart's desire;
verily I say unto thee, thou shalt not return without
accomplishing all thy purpose ³.'

'That Mars, or thundering Jove, might love anew,
Their goddess-wives would ask the "charm" from you.'

'It was an ambush of sweet cares, replete
With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts,

Thus she said; and Hera, mild-eyed queen, smiled
and laid it thenceforth in her own bosom.

224.] Then went Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, to her
house; but Hera flashed forth and left the peak of
Olumpos; and, passing over Pierie, and lovely Emathie',
she sped over the snowy hills of the horse-minding
Thracians, even the topmost crags, nor touched the
ground with her feet. From Athos she hasted over the
billowy sea and came to Lemnos, city of godlike Thoas.
There she encountered Sleep, Death's brother; and
she clasped him by the hand, and called him by name,
and spake :--
'O Sleep, thou king of all gods and of all men, as
erst thou didst hearken unto my word, so now also give
ear; and verily I shall give thee thanks all my days.
Lull me to sleep the shining eyes of Zeus beneath his
brows, soon as I lie beside him in love. Gifts will
I give thee, even a fair golden chair, that shall endure
for ever; Hephaistos my son, that halteth in his steps,
shall deftly fashion it, and set a stool beneath for the
feet, whereon thou mayest place thy bright feet when
thou sittest at the feast.'

this wise :-

Kronos, it were easy to put to sleep any other of the
everlasting gods, aye, even the streams of Okeanos the
River-god, from whom all things spring. But anigh
Zeus, son of Kronos, I may not come, nor put him to
sleep, save at his own behest. Already ere this thy
bidding taught me bitter wisdom on the day that the
high-hearted son of Zeus¹ was sailing Ilionward, after
that he had spoiled the Trojan city. Verily I had
lulled the mind of aegis-bearing Zeus to sleep, shed
sweetly about him; but thou didst devise bane against
Herakles, and rouse the blasts of fell winds over the
deep, and didst bare him anon to well-builded Koös, apart
from all his comrades. Then did Zeus awake in his
fury, casting the gods this way and that about the palace;
and me he sought above all other; and he would have
flung me from heaven into the sea, so that I had
perished, had not Night, that quelleth gods and men,
saved me. To her I came, a suppliant, in my flight; and
Zeus surceased, spite of his wrath; for he feared to do
aught against the mind of swift Night'. And now thou
biddest me do yet another deed that hath no remedy!'
263.] To him Hera, the mild-eyed queen, made
answer :-
'Ah, Sleep, why carest thou for these things? dost
think in sooth that far-seeing Zeus will as surely aid the
Trojans as he was angered about Herakles, his own
son? Nay, go to, I will give unto thee one of the

of her ancient sway. Cf. Milton :-
'Eldest Night and Chaos, ancestors of Nature.'

youthful Graces, to be thy bride, and to be called thy
wife.'
270.] She spake, and Sleep was glad, and made
reply :-
'Come now, swear unto me by the Stygian water,
inviolable; and with one hand lay hold upon the fruitful
earth, and with the other the flashing sea, that all the
gods of the underworld in the house of Kronos may be
our witnesses, that thou wilt give unto me one of the
youthful Graces, even Pasitheê, for whom my soul
yearneth alway.'
277.] He spake; and Hera, white-armed goddess,
hearkened; and she sware to do his bidding, and called
upon the name of all the gods that dwell beneath; the
Titans is their name. But when she had sworn, and
ended that oath, the twain went forth, leaving the cities
of Lemnos and of Imbros, moving lightly upon their
way, clothed in mist. And they came to many-fountained
Ida, mother of wild creatures, even to Lektos, where
first they left the sea; then upon dry land went they,
while the topmost forest shook beneath their feet.
There Sleep abode awhile, or ever he beheld the eyes
of Zeus, and clomb into a lofty pine, that grew upon Ida
then; so tall it was, it clave the mist and reached the
lift. There sate he, close-hid in the pine branches, made
like unto that clear-voiced bird of the hills, that gods
the 'bronze-hued' call, but men the 'eagle owl '.'
1 The identification of kúμuvõis with the Eagle Owl is not at all
certain; but see Rogers, Introd. to the 'Birds' of Aristophanes,
p. xxviii. As Rogers notes, it can hardly be doubted that the bird to
which Sleep is compared is the bird of night; and none but the
mightiest of its kind could be expected to operate with success on the
mightiest of the Gods. The Eagle Owl (bubo maximus) is one of the
largest, boldest, and strongest of birds of prey.

293.] But Hera hasted to Gargaros, that crowneth
lofty Ida; and cloud-gathering Zeus beheld her. And
no sooner had he beheld, than love beset his shrewd
heart, even as when first they were mingled in one, meet-
ing in love's embrace; and their parents wist not of it ¹.
And he stood before her, and hailed her, and spake :-
'Hera, to what end art thou come thus from Olumpos?
lo, there be here neither horses nor chariots, whereon
to ride.'
Then did Hera, craftily dissembling, make answer :-
'I come to visit the uttermost parts of fruitful earth,
Okeanos parent of gods and Mother Tethûs, who
reared me lovingly in their home, and fostered me;
them shall I visit, and loose their endless strifes. For
now a long while have they been severed from mutual
love and friendship, seeing that anger hath fallen heavy
upon them. My horses stand at the foot of many-
fountained Ida; these shall bear me over land and sea.
And now for thy sake am I come hither from Olumpos,
lest haply thou be wroth with me hereafter, if, unbeknown
to thee, I take my way to the home of deep-flowing
Okeanos.'
312.] Then did cloud-gathering Zeus make answer
on this wise :-
--
'Hera, another time thou mayest get thee thither;
but, go to, let us to bed and take our pleasure in love.
Never before did love for goddess or woman, shed all
around my heart, conquer me thus, not even when

fair-ankled Danaë, daughter of Akrisios, who bare
Perseus, most renowned of all men; nor for the
daughter of far-famous Phoinix, who bare unto me
Minos and godlike Rhadamanthos; nor for Semele,
nor Alkmene in Thebes who gave birth to Herakles,

be a joy to mankind'); nor for Demeter, queen of the
lovely locks, nor glorious Leto; nay, not even for thee
thyself, as now I love thee, and sweet desire possesseth
me "."
329.] Then did Queen Hera answer with guile :-
'Dread son of Kronos, what is this thou hast spoken?
If thou be minded to lie with me now, upon Ida's
top, where all is open to view, how if one of the Im-
mortals should behold us slumbering, and should go
among all the gods and publish it? Not to thy house.
could I, arising from the bed, return-nay, it were
a shame. Howbeit, if indeed this is thy wish, and thy
heart desireth it, lo, there is a room wrought thee by thy
son Hephaistos, the stout doors whereof he hath fitted
with bolts. There let us go, and lie down, seeing that

346.] He spake, and the son of Kronos clasped his
wife in his arms. For them did the divine earth
beneath send up new-flowering grass, the dewy lotus,
the crocus, and the hyacinth thick-clustering and soft,
which held them high above the ground. Therein they
laid them down, and clad themselves in a fair mist, all
gold; and twinkling dew-drops rained from the cloud¹.
352.] Thus peacefully slumbered the Father on
Gargaros' summit, overcome by sleep and love, with his
wife held in his arms; but sweet Sleep hied him swiftly
to the ships, to bear a message to the Earth-shaker that

'And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,

compasseth the world. Standing beside him, he spake
winged words :-
'Now do thou aid the Danaoi with right goodwill,
Poseidon. Grant them glory, though but short lived,
while Zeus still sleepeth, seeing I have wrapped him in
soft slumber. Lo, Hera hath charmed him to lie
beside her.'
361.] With such words Sleep sped away to the famous
tribes of men, and heartened Poseidon yet more to aid
the Danaoi. Mightily leapt he amid their foremost, and
urged them on :-
‘Ho, Argives, and shall ye again yield victory to
Hektor son of Priam, to the end that he may take the
ships and win him renown? Nay, he declareth boastingly
that so it will be², in that Achilles tarrieth by the hollow
ships, though sore at heart. Howbeit, we shall not
greatly miss him, if we that remain be encouraged to
help one another. Come then, let us all do my bidding.
Take we the best and mightiest shields in all the host,
cover our heads in gleaming casques, grasp the longest
spear, and issue forth; I will lead the way; and I dare
avow that Hektor, son of Priam, will bide not our coming
for all his eagerness. And let him that is athirst for
the fray, but beareth a small targe upon his shoulder,
give it to a feebler wight; but let himself shelter beneath
an ampler shield.'
378.] He spake; cheerfully they hearkened unto him,
and obeyed. Then did the chieftains themselves, spite
their wounds, set them in array,-to wit, the son of
Tudeus, and Odusseus, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus,

who, going up and down in the midst, caused them to
change their warrior harness; the better man put on the
better harness, and gave the worse to the worse. Now,
when they had clad themselves in gleaming bronze,
onward they stepped; Poseidon, Earth-shaker, was at
their head, holding in his stout hand a dread sword,
like unto lightning; none may meet the edge thereof
in grievous conflict; fear holdeth men back. On the
other side glorious Hektor ranked his Trojans. Then,
I ween, did dark-tressed Poseidon and glorious Hektor
make tense the fell battle-strife, one championing the
Trojans, the other the Argives.
392.] And behold the sea dashed against the tents
and galleys of the Argives; and with a mighty battle-cry
the armies met. Less loud the billow roareth against
the strand, sped from the deep by the North-wind's
frenzied blast; less loud the noise of blazing fire in the
mountain glens, when it ariseth to kindle the forest;
less loud among the high-foliaged oaks shrilleth the
wind which, mightier than all else, belloweth in wrath,
than was the voice of Trojans and Achaians when, with
a dreadful shouting, they charged amain¹.

with his spear at Aias, as he wheeled to face him²; nor
did he miss; the blow fell where the two baldricks
crossed upon his breast, the one the baldrick of his

shield, the other of his silver-studded sword, the which
did guard his tender flesh. And Hektor waxed wroth,
because the keen spear sped vainly from his hand; and
back he drew among his comrades, shunning death.
Then did mighty Aias, Telamon's son, strike him, as he
moved away, with a boulder, one of a multitude that
were rolling at the feet of the fighters, wherewith to
shore the swift ships; a single one he lifted up, and
smote him upon the breast, above the shield-rim, anigh
his neck. With that stroke did Aias whirl him like
a top; and round he spun'. As when, beneath the bolt
of Zeus the Father, falleth an oak uprooted, and a dire
sulphurous stench ariseth therefrom; not unaffrighted

thunderbolt of mighty Zeus: so swift in the dust fell

spear; but upon him his shield was flung and helm,

their javelins; howbeit no one could touch the shepherd

of the folk with sword or spear. For round him stood
the bravest-Pouludamas, and Aineias, and godlike Age-
nor, and Sarpedon prince of the Lukioi, and blameless
Glaukos. And no man of the rest was unheedful, but
they held their round targes before him. Then did his
comrades lift him in their hands and bear him from the
press, till he reached the swift horses, which, with the
charioteer and richly wrought car, stood in the battle's
rear; and these did bear him, deeply groaning, toward
the city.
433.] But when at length they were come to the
ford of the fair-flowing river, eddying Xanthos, son of
immortal Zeus, there they took him out of the chariot
and laid him upon the ground, and poured water upon
him. And he revived, and looked up; and, sitting up
on his heels, he spewed forth dark blood. Then
once again he sank down on the ground, and black
night shrouded his eyes. Thus the blow quelled his
spirit.
440.] Now it came to pass when the Argives beheld
Hektor departing afar, they leaped yet more upon the
Trojans, and remembered the joy of battle. Then,
foremost of all, swift Aias, son of Oïleus, sprang upon
Satnios, son of Enops, and wounded him with sharp-
pointed lance; him a nymph, a blameless naiad, bare
unto Enops as he fed his flock by the banks of Satnioeis.
Oïleus, spear-famous warrior, came anigh and wounded
him in the side; upon his back he fell, and round him
Trojans and Danaoi met in stern encounter. Then did
Panthos' son, Pouludamas, spear-shaker, come to defend
the man; and he smote Prothoënor, son of Areïlukos,
on the right shoulder; through the shoulder the heavy
spear kept its way; and in the dust he fell, and clutched

the earth with his palm. Whereat Pouludamas, with
far-sounding cry, uttered a measureless boast:-
'Not vainly, in its turn, hath the dart, methinks,
sprung from the stalwart hand of Panthos' high-hearted
son; nay, but some Argive hath received it in his flesh;
and, methinks, with this for staff, will he go down to
the house of Hades.'
458.] He spake, and the Argives were pained by
reason of his vaunt, but chiefly was the heart of Aias
stirred within him¹. As the other turned him away,
Aias launched swiftly a shining spear; and though
Pouludamas escaped black death, with nimble swerve 2,
Archelochos, Antenor's son, caught it in his body; for
the gods had decreed his death. The spear smote him
at the jointure of head and neck, on the spine's topmost
bone, and shore away both tendons; and, in his fall,
head and mouth and nostrils touched earth or ever legs
and knees came to the ground.
Then did Aias cry aloud to blameless Pouludamas :—
'Bethink thee, Pouludamas, and speak me true: is not
this man worthy to be slain in Prothoënor's stead? I
deem he is no base wight, nor sprung of a base stock,
but brother-or son-of horse-taming Antenor; for me-
thought he was nigh akin unto him in descent.'
475.] Thus spake he, though well he knew who he
was; and anguish laid hold upon the Trojans. Then
did Akamas with his spear wound Promachos, a

Boiotian, as he bestrode his brother¹; and he drew
him away by the feet. And Akamas, with a mighty
shout, made immeasurable boast:-
'Arrow-loving Argives, insatiate of threats, surely not
to us alone shall sorrow and lamentation come, but ye
likewise one day shall, even as he, lie slain. Mark ye
now how Promachos sleepeth, quelled by spear of mine,
to the end that a brother's blood-price may not be long
time unavenged. Wherefore also doth a man pray
that a kinsman be left behind in his house, to save him
from harm³.'
486.] Thus he spake, and the Argives were stung by
his taunts; but most of all he roused the wrath of war-
like Peneleos. He rushed upon Akamas; but he bided
not the oncoming of prince Peneleos; and the spear fell
upon Ilioneus, son of Phorbas rich in flocks, whom
Hermes loved more than all the Trojans, and gave him
great possessions; and to Hermes his mother had
borne him, an only son. Him now did Peneleos wound
beneath the forehead, in the eye-socket, and thrust
out the eye-ball; right through eye and tendon drave
the spear, and the man sank down, with both hands
outspread. Then Peneleos drew forth his keen sword,
and smote upon the middle of his neck, and shore away
the head, casque and all; but the heavy spear was still
in his eye; and he lifted up the head upon his spear-
point, as one would lift up a poppy on its stalk, and

bade the Trojans mark it, and uttered a vaunting
word :-
-
'Ho, ye Trojans, bid sire and mother of haughty
Ilioneus make lamentation in their halls; for neither
they nor the wife of Promachos, Alegenor's son, shall
ever be rejoiced by the home-coming of her loved
spouse, whenever the warriors of Achaia return at
length from Troy in their ships.'
He ended, and fear and trembling fell upon them all;
and each man looked about him, how he might escape
sheer death.
Tell me now, ye Muses¹ that haunt Olumpos, who
first of the Achaians bare away the bloody spoils of
heroes slain, when the famed Earth-shaker had turned
aside the battle. Aias, son of Telamon, was first, who
wounded Hurtios son of Gurtios, chief of the doughty
Musoi; and Antilochos slew Phalkes and Mermeros;
and Meriones killed Moros and Hippotion, and Teukros
reft life from Prothoön and Periphetes. Next did
Menelaos, Atreus' son, wound Huperenor, shepherd of
the folk, in the flank, and the bronze let out the entrails
as it clave them asunder; and the life sped quickly
adown the gaping wound, and darkness covered his
eyes.
But most did Aias slay, Oïleus' swift son; for none
was his match in following upon the heels of a flying
foe, when Zeus had turned them to rout.

the story; but here such appeal is out of place. There is no crisis.

THE REPULSE FROM THE SHIPS'
Zeus, awakening on Ida, reproaches Hera, who at length appeases
him. The goddess, moving to the Assembly of the Gods, endeavours
to kindle their resentment against Zeus; she succeeds in rousing
Ares to fury, but Athena calms his wrath. Iris and Apollo obey the
behest of their father Zeus. Iris commands Poseidon to retire from
the battle-field, to which he reluctantly consents. At the bidding of
Zeus, Apollo puts new strength into Hektor; whereupon the Trojan
host presses once more on the Greek ships, which Aias valiantly
defends. Patroklos, alarmed for the safety of the camp, makes his
way to Achilles, for the purpose of urging him to take the field. The
Trojan troops advance with torches, and set fire to the Greek fleet.
SCENE:-(1) On Ida and Olumpos.
(2) Before the Greek Ships.
But when, in their flight, the Trojans had passed both
stakes and trench, and many had been laid low beneath
the hands of the Danaoi, then halted they, biding hard by
the cars, pale with fear, and cowed; while Zeus awoke
on Ida's peaks, from beside gold-throned Hera. Up
sprang he and stood, beholding Trojans and Achaians,-
those dumfoundered, and the Argives driving them

for not the feeblest of the Achaians¹ had smitten him.
And, when he saw him, the Father of gods and men
had compassion upon him; and, with direful scowl, thus
spake he unto Hera :-
14.] 'Impracticable Hera! of a truth thy mischievous
plot hath kept divine Hektor from the battle, and routed
his people. Belike, hereafter, thou wilt be the first to
reap the fruits of thy grievous intrigue, and I scourge
thee with my bolts. Dost thou not mind thee of the day
when thou hangedst from on high? To thy feet I bound
two stones, and cast about thy hands a chain of gold,
not to be broken; and thou didst hang there amid the
clouds of heaven. Then were the gods exceeding
wroth throughout lofty Olumpos; yet could they not
set thee free, though they drew near; and whomso-
ever I lighted upon, him I seized and hurled from
the crystal battlement, that he might come to earth,

send in company with the North-wind over the un-
harvested sea, making the tempests do thy bidding;
and then to Köos, that goodly isle, thou didst carry him
away. Him I rescued thence, and brought him back

2 Celsus, in his 'Aλŋēǹs Aóyos, explains this barbarous legend in
a quaint fashion. According to him the words of Zeus are addressed
to Matter, as indicating that God laid hold of matter in a state of
chaos, and reduced it to order and fixed law. To such sorry shifts
are allegorists, whether pagan or Christian, often reduced!
The reference is, of course, to Hephaistos: see Book i. 591.

things a second time will I remind thee, that thou
cease thy tricksy ways; so shalt thou know whether
love's blandishments will avail thee, wherewith thou
didst come, apart from the gods, and beguile me?'
34] Thus he spake; but Hera, mild-eyed queen,
shuddered, and lifted up her voice and spake winged
words:-
'Let earth be now my witness, and the wide heaven
above, and that falling water of the Stux, greatest oath
and most terrible of the blessed gods, and thine own
sacred head and our bridal bed, whereby I may never
swear lightly: not through any wish of mine doth
Poseidon, who shaketh earth, vex the Trojans and
Hektor, and lend succour to their foes; nay, rather, his
own mood urgeth him on, and constraineth him, for his
eyes beheld the Achaians overborne at their ships, and
he had compassion upon them. But, of a truth, I am
even ready to exhort him to walk in the way wherein
thou leadest, O cloud-girt King.'
47.] She spake; the Father of men and gods smiled;
and thus he answered her with winged words:-
'Nay, Hera, mild-eyed queen, if thy thoughts were as
my thoughts, when thou sittest among the Immortals,

speakest, go now in quest of the companies of heaven;
summon hither Iris, and Apollo, famed for his bow; that
she may hie her to the host of mailed Achaians and bid
Poseidon the king to cease from war and betake him to
his own home; and that Phoibos Apollo may rouse
Hektor to battle, and breathe new courage into him, and
cause him to forget the pangs which now tear his heart,
and, turning aside the Achaians, send upon them a craven
fear, that so, in their flight, they may fall among the
benched galleys of Achilles, son of Peleus. He will
rouse his friend, Patroklos; and him shall glorious
Hektor slay with the sword, in front of Ilion; but not
till he have destroyed many a lusty warrior, and among
them mine own son, divine Sarpedon. In wrath for his
friend, godlike Achilles will slay Hektor. Next after
that will I bring to pass a repulse from the ships,
without pause, until the Achaians have captured lofty
Ilion through the counsels of Athena. Till then I abate
not my wrath; nor shall I suffer any god to aid the
Danaoi here, or ever the desire of Achilles be accom-
plished, even as I promised him at the first-and
ratified my promise with a nod—in the day when divine
Thetis clasped my knees, beseeching me to honour
Achilles, the destroyer of cities.'

of opinion.

Hera, disobey, but made her way from Ida's hills unto
high Olumpos. Swift as upspringeth the thought of one
who, travelled in many a land, thinketh to himself, deep
in his wise heart, 'Would I were here, or there!' and
he conceiveth many desires: so swift was queen Hera
in her eager flight'.
And she came to steep Olumpos, and appeared before
the immortal gods assembled together in the house of
Zeus. And when they saw her, they all sprang up, and
pledged her with their cups. The rest passed she by,
but took the cup at the hands of fair-cheeked Themis;
for she was the first to run and greet her; and she ac-
costed her with winged words :-
·
Hera, why art thou afoot? thou seemest as one
astonished. Can it be that the son of Kronos, thy
husband, hath affrighted thee?'
Then did the goddess, white-armed Hera, make
reply :-

of what sort his mood is, how overweening and how
harsh. Nay, prepare thou an ample banquet for the gods,

shalt thou hear what ill deeds Zeus setteth forth; I trow
I shall not gladden the hearts of everyone alike, be he

feast!'
100.] With such words queen Hera sate her down;
and throughout the palace of Zeus the gods were heavy
at heart". With her lips she smiled, but in her eyes,
over darkened brows, no laughter shone; and thus,
indignant, spake she before them all :-
'Fools! who in our madness are wroth with Zeus *.
We be minded, forsooth, to come near unto him, and
thwart him by glozing word, or force; but he, sitting
apart, recketh not, no, nor heedeth; for he boasteth that,
among the Immortals, he is pre-eminent alike in power
and in might. Wherefore endure what evil soever he
sendeth to each. For ere this, I trow, calamity hath
been wrought for Ares, if not for another. For he
whom mighty Ares claimeth to be his own, Askalaphos,
his best-beloved, is dead-slain in battle".'

Cf. Jeremy Taylor, Remedies against Fear and Death :-'To be
angry with God, to quarrel with the divine providence by repining
against an unutterable, a natural, and an easy sentence, is a huge
folly, and the parent of much trouble.'
Hera, while openly counselling submission, is secretly fomenting
rebellion; and by condoling with Ares on his son's death, is
cunningly working upon his fierce temper.

this wise:-
'Blame me not, ye dwellers in Olumpos, that I go
hence to the Achaian ships to avenge my son, even
though it be my doom to lie among the dead,
amid blood and dust, stricken with the thunder of
Zeus'.'
Such words he uttered; and he bade Fear and
Flight yoke his steeds, but himself donned his shining
armour. Thereupon furiousness and anger, greater
and more terrible than heretofore, had befallen the
Immortals at the hands of Zeus, had not Athena, fearful
for all her peers, sped through the vestibule, leaving the
throne whereon she had sat ; from his head she snatched
the helm, and the targe from his shoulders, and took
the bronze spear from his doughty hand, and stood it
upright. Then fastened she upon impetuous Ares with
these words :-
128.] 'Maddened-distraught in mind-thou art be-
side thyself! Surely in vain hast thou ears to hear with ;
understanding and discretion are departed from thee 3.
Hast thou not heard the words of Hera, white-armed
goddess, who hath but now come from the presence of

will leave high-hearted Trojans and Achaians alike;
and hitherward will he come to drive us in wild rout,
and will lay hold both upon the guilty and upon the
guiltless. Therefore I counsel thee now to lay aside
thine anger for thine own son; ere now mightier
and braver than he have fallen, or shall hereafter fall;
and it is a hard matter to keep watch over the birth and
generation of all men.'
142.] With such words she set impetuous Ares upon
his throne. Then Hera called Apollo out of the hall,
and Iris, who is messenger of the Immortals, and hailed
them with winged words :-
'Zeus biddeth you go with all speed unto Ida; and
when ye have come thither, and looked upon the face of
Zeus, whatsoever he commandeth, that do.'
And when she had thus spoken, Hera the queen went
back, and sate upon her throne; but the twain leaped
forth, and flew; and they came to many-fountained Ida,
mother of wild beasts, and found the far-seeing son of
Kronos sitting upon topmost Gargaros; and round
about him was wreathed an incense-breathing cloud¹.
Then went they and stood before cloud-gathering Zeus.
And when he beheld them, he was well pleased, because
they had hearkened swiftly unto the words of Hera,
his wife. Then did he accost Iris first with winged
words :-
'Get thee gone, swift Iris, and bear this message unto
Poseidon the king, nor misreport my words. Bid him
surcease from war and battle, and hie him to the com-
panies of the Gods, or into the divine sea. And if he
will not obey my words, but shall make light thereof,

then let him ponder well in heart and mind, whether,
mighty though he is, he dare to meet my onslaught,
seeing I boast myself far stronger than he, and elder
born; yet he it is whose heart feareth not to match him-
self with me, me, of whom all else stand in awe!'
168.] Thus spake he; nor did wind-swift Iris disobey,
but betook her from Ida's heights to sacred Ilion. As
when from clouds flieth forth the snow, or icy hail,
driven by the blasts of the chill North wind', so swiftly
did rapid Iris wing her flight, and stood anigh, and thus
addressed the famed Earth-shaker :-
'Thou that upholdest the earth, dark-tressed lord,
hither am I come bearing unto thee a message from
aegis-holding Zeus. He biddeth thee surcease from war
and battle, and get thee to the companies of the gods,
or unto the divine sea. But if thou wilt not obey his
words, but make light thereof, he threatened that he too
would come hither to do battle with thee, his might
matched against thine. And he biddeth thee avoid his
hands, since he boasteth himself far mightier than thee,
and elder born. Yet thou art he whose heart feareth
not to match itself with him, him of whom all else stand
in awe!'
184.] Then the famed Earth-shaker, deeply incensed,
made answer unto Iris :-
'Out upon it! verily hath Zeus, for all his power,

against my will, that am his peer in honour. For we
be three brethren, sons of Kronos and of Rhea our

dead¹; threefold, in all, was the division of things, and
each hath his meed of honour. Know that, when we were
a-casting lots, it fell unto me to dwell in the hoary sea
forever; unto Hades fell the misty gloom; and to Zeus
the broad heaven amid the upper air and clouds. But
the earth still bideth a common possession, as also doth
Olumpos. Therefore will I not live according to the
mind of Zeus; nay, though he be great, yet let him
abide in peace in his own share. But let him not
threaten me with his hands, as if I were wholly base;
better that he should with fearsome words threaten his
sons and daughters, his own begotten; they shall
hearken to his bidding, for they must.'

"Thou that upholdest earth, dark-tressed lord, is this
the message, harsh and unbending, that I am to carry
thus unto Zeus; or wilt thou change thy mood? Surely
the thoughts of the wise may be turned. Thou knowest
that the Erinnues ² ever serve the elder-born.'

replied :-

folk; then plunged into the deep. And much the
warriors of Achaia missed his aid. Then did cloud-
gathering Zeus speak unto Apollo :—
Go now,

compasseth the land, gone into the divine sea, shunning

strength that is his, until the Achaians come fleeing to
their ships and to the Hellespont. After which I my-
self will bethink me what to do and say, that the Achaians
may once more have respite from their toil.'
236.] He spake; nor did Apollo refuse to hearken
unto his sire, but hied him from the hills of Ida, swift'
as the dove-slaying hawk, fleetest of all birds.
He found the son of warrior-hearted Priam, divine
Hektor, no longer stretched at length, but sitting, and
newly brought to himself; of his comrades that were
around him he was beginning to be aware; and the
sweat and gasping were stayed, for the purpose of aegis-
holding Zeus raised him up. Then far-darting Apollo
stood near and accosted him :-
'Hektor, son of Priam, why apart from others sittest
thou, thy power gone from thee?² say, hath some sorrow
befallen thee?'
246.] Him did Hektor of the glancing helm answer,
with faltering voice :-
'Who of the gods, most noble sir, art thou that askest
of me, face to face? Knowest thou not that, what
time I was slaying his comrades by the Achaians' ships,
Aias, that brave warrior, struck me on the breast with
a huge stone, and quenched my warrior powers? Verily,
I thought within me, when I lay a-gasping, that this day
I should behold the dead, and the house of Hades.'

which implies a variant from the traditional text of Homer, which
has ὀλιγηπελέων).

And king Apollo, son of Zeus, answered and said unto
him :-
'Be now of good cheer; such an ally hath Zeus sent
from Ida, to stand beside and to aid thee, even me,
Phoibos Apollo, lord of the sword, who have guarded
thee from of old, alike both thee and the lofty city. But
go to, now, bid thy charioteers-and they are many-
drive their swift steeds to the hollow ships. And, behold,
I shall go before, and make all the way smooth for the
steeds, and shall turn Achaia's heroes to flight.'
262.] With such words he breathed huge courage into
the shepherd of the people. As when a stalled horse',
full-fed at the manger, breaketh his bonds asunder, and
with clattering hooves speedeth over the plain, eager
for the fair-flowing stream wherein he was wont to bathe,
the while he rejoiceth in his strength; high he reareth his
head, and over his shoulders floateth his mane; in his
beauty putteth he his trust, while his limbs bear him lightly
to haunts where steeds find pasture: so nimbly did
Hektor ply feet and knees, urging on his steeds, when he
heard the voice of the God. As dogs and rustic hunters
rouse from his lair an antlered stag, or wild goat, to
whom steep rock and bosky wood give refuge, nor is it
their lot to reach the quarry; but lo, at their clamour
a bearded lion appeared in the way, and quickly turneth
them aside, for all their eagerness: even so, for a space,
the Danaoi followed ever on, in throngs, thrusting with
spears and two-pointed lances; but when they espied
Hektor assailing the warrior ranks they were sore afraid,
and the hearts of all fell at their feet 2.

281.] Then up spake Thoas in their midst, Andrai-
mon's son, flower of Aitolia's chivalry, cunning with the
lance, and valorous in the hand-to-hand: in the assembly,
few of the Achaians could surpass him, whensoever the
young men vied with one another in debate :-
'Ho now, great is the marvel I behold! Hektor is
risen up anew, and hath shunned the Fates. Verily
the heart of each rejoiced to think that he was dead—
slain by the hands of Aias, son of Telamon. Howbeit,
some god hath shielded and saved Hektor, who ere now
hath loosed the knees of many a Danaan, and will, I
trow, so do again; for not without the aid of loud-thunder-
ing Zeus standeth he thus in the forefront, eager to do
battle. But come, let us all do my bidding. Let us bid
the multitude return to the ships; but let us, who boast
ourselves to be bravest in the host, bide our ground, if
perchance we may withstand him at the outset, meeting
him with levelled spears. Methinks, for all his ardour,
he will fear to cast himself into the Danaan ranks.'
300.] He spake; the others hearkened unto him
gladly, and obeyed. Then the two Aiantes, and prince
Idomeneus, Teukros, and Meriones, and Meges, peer of
Ares, with all their hosts, closed up their ranks, and
called upon their champions to meet Hektor and his
Trojans; and, behind them, the multitude withdrew to
the Achaian ships.
306.] Then did the Trojans move on in serried mass;
Hektor led the van with long strides. Before him went
Phoibos Apollo, his shoulders girt with cloud, bearing

the impetuous aegis', terrible, shaggy with hair, bright-
flashing, which Hephaistos the armourer had given to
Zeus for the putting to flight of men; the which was in
his hands as he marshalled the people to war. Close-
ranked the Argives bided their onset, and a shrill cry
from either side rose up, and arrows leapt from the
bowstring; many a javelin, sped by valorous hands,
buried themselves in the flesh of doughty warriors;
many fell half way, or ever they grazed white skin, and
stood fixed in earth, all eager to glut themselves with
blood. Long as Phoibos Apollo grasped the aegis
unwaveringly, so long the bolts reached their mark on
both sides, while the people fell2; but when, looking
full in the face of the swift-horsed Danaoi, he shook the
aegis, and himself cried out with an exceeding loud cry,
he bewitched the heart within them, and they forgat
their fiery courage. As two beasts of prey make havoc
of a herd of oxen, or numerous flock of sheep, in the
hour of darkest midnight, falling suddenly upon them,
when no watcher is nigh to guard: so were the Achaians
routed, and waxed helpless; for Apollo sent fear upon
them, but unto Hektor and the Trojans gave he
renown.
328.] Then, as the masses brake, man slew man:
Hektor laid Stichios and Arkesilaos low, the latter a
leader of the bronze-mailed Boiotians, the former a
trusty friend of great-hearted Menestheus; and Aineias
slew Medon and Iasos. Medon was the bastard son of
godlike Orleus, and was brother of Aias; he dwelt in
¹ aiyida boûpıv, made of metal. The later notion of a goatskin arose
from a false etymology which connected the word with ait, goat.

ready to spoil their enemies, that the Achaians dashed
headlong into the dug trench with its pallisades, scat-
tered in flight this way and that, and were constrained 2
to hide them behind the rampart. Then did Hektor
with a loud cry, call upon the Trojans :-

'Hurl ye yourselves upon the ships, and let be the
bloody spoils! Whomsoever I mark otherwhere, afar
from the ships, for him shall I devise death here and
now; nor shall his kindred, male or female, yield him

from the shoulder, drave his horses against the foe,
calling aloud upon the Trojans. They all, answering

his call, guided their charioted steeds with noise un-

as when some child, beside the seashore, tumbleth
down the sand; in childish glee he fashioneth it for a
plaything; anon he confoundeth it with feet and hands,
in very wantonness¹: even so didst thou, Phoibos, lord of
the bow, confound the toil and moil of the Argives, and
into the men themselves send panic.
367.] Thus they came to a halt beside the ships,
calling unto one another; and, lifting hands to all the
gods prayed earnestly, each man; more than all did
Nestor, knight of Gerene, guardian of the Achaians,
make supplication, stretching hands toward the starry
heaven :-
2
'Father Zeus, if ever, even in Argos with its rich
tilths, any among us, with sacrifice of the fat thighs of
sheep or oxen, offered prayer for a safe home-coming;
and thou didst promise and give assent; call to re-
membrance these things, O lord of Olumpos, and stave
off the pitiless day, nor suffer thus the Achaians to yield
before the Trojans.'
1 A delightful and apposite simile.
Homer has an affection for
such homely images, provided they are apt.

Zeus had given his promise of safe return (Leaf). By Argos is meant

Thus he prayed, and wise-counselling Zeus thundered
mightily, hearkening to the prayers of that old man,
Neleus' son.
379.] Now it was so, when the Trojans heard the
thunder of aegis-bearing Zeus, they leapt the more
fiercely upon the Argives, and called to remembrance
the joy of battle. As when a huge billow of the wide-
wayed sea sweepeth over a vessel's bulwarks, urged
onward by a mighty wind, which increaseth exceedingly
the waves: so did the Trojans pour down upon the wall
with loud clamour, and, driving their steeds thereinto,
fought beside their poops with two-pointed spears, hand
to hand-the Trojans from their chariots, the Danaoi
from their ships into which they had mounted, high
above the foe. With long spars they fought, which lay
to their hand at the ships; jointed, these ',-gear apt for
naval warfare, their points tipt with bronze.
-
390.] Now Patroklos, while Achaians and Trojans
were fighting for the wall, away from the swift ships, sat
in the tent of tender-hearted Eurupulos, soothing him
with talk, and on his grievous wound was busy laying
simples to heal him of his dark pains. But when he
marked the Trojans assaulting the wall, amid the loud
cries and flight of the Danaoi, he groaned, and smote his
thighs with open hands, and spake aloud in his anguish:-
¹ koλλýevтα, acc. to Leaf, means that these poles or spars were
made of pieces glued side by side, so arranged that their ends lay at
different distances, in order to gain strength. I should, however,
have supposed that they were jointed together like a modern fishing-
rod. Its use was two-fold: (1) to keep the enemy from boarding,
(2) to defend ships when attacked on shore (as here).
2 Or, perhaps, stories. Before a written literature existed the
Aoyorolós was, no doubt, in due demand, like the minstrel or jongleur
in the Middle Ages.

'Eurupulos, no longer can I bide here beside thee,
for all thy need of me; for, behold, a great battle is
afoot¹. Nay, but let my squire comfort thee, and I shall
hasten unto Achilles, that I may rouse him to the fray.
Who knoweth but that, with heaven's grace, I may
move him by my counsel? Great is the persuasion of
a friend.'
405.] Thus spake he, and his feet bare him away;
but the Achaians awaited the oncoming Trojans, unflinch
ingly; notwithstanding, they could not drive them,
though a scantier host, from beside the ships, nor
could the Trojans at any time break the Danaan ranks
and get into the midst of tents and ships. As a rule
straighteneth a ship's plank, in the hands of a cunning
workman, who hath ripe knowledge of all his craft, by
grace of Athena : so fairly stretched on either side lay
the conflict of war 2.

others by another; but Hektor rushed to meet renowned

Aias. These twain plied their toil around a single
ship; yet could not Hektor drive out Aias, and set the
ships ablaze, nor the other force back his foe, seeing it
was the will of heaven that had brought him nigh.
Then did glorious Aias with his spear smite Kaletor,
son of Klutios, full in the breast as he was bearing fire
to a ship; down fell he with a crash, and the torch
dropped from his grasp. And when Hektor perceived
his cousin fallen in the dust, before the black ship, he
called unto the Trojans and the Lukioi with a loud
cry:-
------
'Ye Trojans and Lukioi and Dardans delighting in
close conflict, no wise yield thee in this stress of con-
flict; but save the son of Klutios, lest the Achaians
spoil of his harness him that hath fallen amid this
gathering of the ships.'
429.] With such words he launched at Aias a gleam-
ing spear; Aias he missed; he hit Lukophron, Mastor's
son, the squire of Aias, who hailed from Kuthera, and
dwelled with Aias,-seeing he had slain a man in holy
Kuthera¹,-him he smote upon the head, above the ear,
with the pointed bronze, while he stood beside Aias.
Backward in the dust upon the ground fell he, from the
ship's stern, and his limbs were loosened in death.
Then did Aias shudder 2, and call aloud unto his
brother :-
'Teukros, dear heart, behold now is our trusty friend
slain, the son of Mastor, who sojourned with us in
Kuthera, whom we honoured in our home even as we

honoured our loved parents; him hath mighty-hearted
Hektor slain. Where be now thine arrows, winged
with swift death, and the bow given thee by Phoibos
Apollo ?'
442.] Thus he spake; and Teukros hearkened, and
ran and stood beside him, having in his hand a supple¹ bow
and a quiver full of shafts. Right speedily launched he
his arrows against the Trojans; Kleitos he hit, noble
son of Peisenor, friend of Pouludamas, Panthoös' brave
son, as he grasped the reins. Busied was he with his
horses; for he had driven them where the fight was
thickest, to win grace of Hektor and his Trojans; but
quickly came upon him the doom which no man, be his
wishes what they might, could turn aside. For the
cruel shaft had planted itself in his neck, behind³; and
he fell from the chariot, and his horses swerved aside,
rattling the empty car. But prince Pouludamas was
swift to mark it, and was the first to run and meet the
horses; these he gave to Astunoös, son of Protiaon,
and diligently charged him to keep them nigh at hand,
watching the issue of the day; but he himself went
back and mingled with the champions.
458.] Then Teukros aimed another arrow against
Hektor of the brazen helm, and would have ended the
conflict at the Achaian ships, had he smitten him and
reft away his life as he played the hero. But he escaped
not the all-seeing mind of Zeus, who guarded Hektor,
and robbed Teukros, Telamon's son, of his proud
boast; for Teukros snapped the well-twisted string

upon his good bow, even as he drew it against Hektor;
and the bronze-tipt shaft fell wide, and the bow dropped
from his hand. And Teukros shuddered¹, and called
aloud to his brother :-
'Out upon it! surely some God bringeth wholly to
naught the devices of our warfare, seeing he hath struck
the bow from my hand, and broken asunder the newly-
twisted string, which I bound upon it early this day, to
bear my quick-flying shafts.'
471.] And Aias, Telamon's mighty son made
answer :-
'Dear heart, suffer thy bow and thy thick-flying
arrows to lie there, seeing some god hath confounded
them, in his grudge against the Danaoi. But take thy
long spear in thy hands, and thy shield upon thy
shoulder, and fight against the Trojans, and stir up the
people also. Perdy, not without a struggle must they
capture, though victorious, our well-benched galleys:
nay, let us remember the joy of battle!'
He spake, and Teukros set down the bow in his tent,
and lay about his shoulders a fourfold shield²; upon
his stalwart head he placed a well-wrought casque; and
he chose him a sturdy spear, pointed with sharp bronze;
and so strode forth, and ran swiftly, and stood beside
Aias.
484.] Now when Hektor saw that the weapons of
Teukros had been marred, he shouted aloud, and called
upon the Trojans and Lukioi:-

'Trojans, Lukioi, and Dardans famed in close
conflict, quit you like men, my friends, and bethink you
of martial valour at the hollow ships; for verily with
mine eyes have I beheld the weapons of a mighty

Zeus is easy to be seen among men, whensoever he

courage into each man's heart. And Aias, on his side,
urged on his comrades :-
'Shame upon you, men of Argos! this day is death
assured, or salvation, and the warding of peril from
our ships. Think ye, if Hektor of the waving plume

device surpassing this,-to unite heart and hand in the
fray. Better to die once for all¹ or to win life, than be
slowly straitened to death in dread conflict,—and all for
naught, beside the ships, at the hands of meaner men.'
514.] With such words he put new strength and
courage into each. Then Hektor slew Schedios,
Perimedes' son, chief of the Phokians; and Aias slew
Laödamas, leader of the footmen, Antenor's noble
son; and Pouludamas spoiled Otos of Kullene, friend of
Phuleus' son, champion of the high-hearted Epeioi.
Whom when Meges marked, he rushed upon him; but
Pouludamas slipped from under him. And Meges
missed him, for Apollo suffered not Panthoös' son to
be struck down among the foremost; but with his spear
he wounded Kroismos full in the breast. With a crash
he fell, and his foeman stripped the armour from his
shoulders. Meanwhile Dolops, deft spearman, sprang
upon him,-Dolops, master of impetuous might, whom
Lampos, bravest-born of men, begat. It was Dolops
who, close-countering, smote with his spear the son of
Phuleus amid shield; but the stout corslet that he wore
saved him; fitted it was with breast and back pieces,
and Phuleus had brought it out of Ephure, from the
river Selleis; for his friend Euphetes, king of men,
had given it him to wear in battle, a defence against foes;
and this day it warded destruction from his son's body.
With keen blade did Meges pierce the topmost ridge of
that his brazen helmet, horse-hair-crested, and shear
therefrom the horse-hair plume; and now all in the
dust, upon the earth, fell the crest, lately so resplendent

handle the arms of Dolops? Come, follow on! for no
longer can we fight the Argives, holding aloof, but hand
to hand, till we slay them, or they capture lofty Ilion
utterly, and get possession of her citizens.'

the godlike chieftain; and meantime Aias, son of Tela-

saved than slain; but, when they flee, methinks no
honour is won, nor is there any defence ¹.'
Thus he spake; but they were eager, even of them-
selves, to beat off the foe; and they took to heart that
saying, and fenced about the ships with a wall of bronze;
while Zeus aroused the Trojans. Then did Menelaos,
brave warrior, stir up Antilochos :-
'Antilochos, none other of the Achaians is fuller than
thou of youthful strength, nor swifter on his feet, nor so
doughty as thou in battle; now spring thou forth, and
smite some Trojan to earth'.'
572.] With such words he himself drew back, but
goaded the other on. Out from the foremost ranks
rushed he, and, after a swift glance about him, launched
a glittering spear. The Trojans quailed before that cast;
not in vain had the spear flown forth, but it smote high-
hearted Melanippos, Hiketaon's son, as he moved to war,
upon the breast, hard by the pap. With a clash he fell,
and darkness covered his eyes. Then leaped Antilochos
upon him, swift as a hound that springs upon a wounded
fawn, the which some hunter hath chanced to strike, as
from its couch it boundeth, and hath loosed its limbs in
death: so upon thee, Melanippos, bounded staunch Anti-
lochos, in act to strip thee of thine armour. But Hektor
was ware thereof, who came to meet him running swiftly
through the press of battle; and Antilochos bided not
his coming, for all he was an eager warrior, but fled
away, like to some wild beast that hath wrought a mis-

flieth, or ever the throng of men be gathered together:
so fled the son of Nestor; and Hektor and the Trojans,
with shout amazing, poured forth a hail of cruel darts.
Then turned he about, and stood his ground, soon as
he had reached the ranks of his comrades.
592.] Meantime the Trojans, like ravening lions, fell
upon the ships, accomplishing the will of Zeus who ever
woke within them a mighty strength, but bewitched the
heart of the Argives, and minished their renown; but
the Trojans spurred he on. For the purpose of his
heart was to give glory to Hektor, son of Priam, that
upon the beaked ships he might cast the fury of unweary-
ing fire, and so accomplish to the full the unrighteous²
prayer of Thetis; for this was what wise-counselling
Zeus had been awaiting³-to behold with his eyes the
flare of a burning ship. Thereafter he willed to bring
about a repulse of the Trojans from the ships, and to
yield honour to the Danaoi.
With such thoughts he stirred up Hektor, son of
Priam, at the hollow ships, himself withal nothing loth.
Fiercely he raged, like Ares with brandished spear;

him, leaped amid the throng, and fell upon them, as
when there falleth on some swift ship a furious wave,
wind-nurtured in cloudy weather; and all the ship is
whelmed by foam, and the wind's fell blast shrieketh in
the shrouds, and the mariners tremble for very fear,
seeing they are swept all but into the jaws of death:
even so was the spirit of the Achaians shaken within
their breasts.
630.] As a lion, eager to destroy, cometh down upon
the cattle; they, the while, feed numberless on pasturage
of some wide fen, but the herdsman wotteth not as yet
how to do battle with the lion for the life of a horned
ox: he, belike, with the foremost or hindmost kine
rangeth himself ever, but on the midmost springeth
that wild beast, and devoureth a cow, while the rest flee
in terror: so were the Achaians, one and all, marvellously
scattered that hour by Hektor and by Father Zeus.
Yet did Hektor slay no man, save Periphetes of Muke-
nai, own son of Kopreus, who was wont to go from
Eurustheus to the might of Herakles, with tidings of his
labours. Far nobler he than the father that begat him,
-nobler in all things excellent, both speed of foot and
warlike prowess; in mind, also, he was counted among
the foremost of Mukenai's folk; he it was that now gave
into Hektor's hands surpassing fame. For as he turned
back, he stumbled against the rim of his own shield,
down-reaching to the feet, the which he bare for defence
against javelins; wherein entangled, backward he fell;
and, as he fell, his helm clattered direly about his temples.
But Hektor was quick to mark, and ran and stood beside

him, and drave the spear into his bosom, and slew
him within hail of his loved comrades; but they, albeit
their hearts were sore because of their comrade, could
not help, for themselves did grievously fear godlike
Hektor.
653.] Now had the Argives got in between the ships¹;
and the ships that were drawn up highest on the land,
encircled them; and the Trojans poured in upon them.
Then were the Argives forced to retreat behind the fore-
most ships; anon they rallied, and stood their ground
together, close beside the tents; nor were they scattered
throughout the host, for shame and fear withheld them;
and they exhorted one another unceasingly. But most
of all did Nestor, Gerene's knight, warder of the
Achaians, make supplication, adjuring each man by his
children :-
661.] 'My friends, quit you like men; cherish in
your souls the respect of others; and be ye mindful,
each one, of children, and wife, and possessions, and
parents 2. For them-the absent-I beseech you here to
stand firm, and not turn cravenly to flight.'
He spake; and roused the strength and heart of each
warrior. And Athena took a great cloud of mist from off
their eyes; and plenteous light revealed itself to them
on either side, both toward the ships and toward the
equal-balanced war; and all men discerned Hektor,
that brave warrior, and his comrades, both they that

stood apart and fought not, and they that plied the battle
by the swift ships.
673.] Now it pleased great-hearted Ares no longer to
bide idle, where the other sons of Achaia stood apart';
but with huge strides he paced up and down the decks
of the ships, swinging in his hands a mighty handspike,
two and twenty cubits long, joined together with sockets.
As a well-skilled rider harnesseth together four horses
out of many; then, starting them from the plain, urgeth
them swiftly along the populous highway, and many,
both men and women, marvel as they behold him; he,
firmly and with never a slip, oft passeth from one steed
unto another in turn, while they still fly onward : even so
went Aias with huge strides up and down the deck of
many a swift ship, and his voice reached to heaven; and
ever, with shout horrific, would he bid the Danaoi defend
their ships and tents. Nor did Hektor tarry amid the
press of mail-clad warriors; but, as a tawny eagle down-
swoopeth on a flock of winged birds that feed beside a
stream-geese, or cranes, or long-necked swans,—so did
Hektor, with fierce rush, head straight at the dark-
prowed ship; and him did Zeus thrust from behind
with a mighty hand, and spurred on the folk with him.
696.] Again bitter fighting was wrought beside the
ships; well mightest thou say that they faced one another
in battle, unwearied and unyielding; so fierce the
conflict. But diverse was the thought within the
warriors' hearts: the Achaians deemed not they would
scape the peril, but perish; while, in the Trojans, each

one, hope waxed high that they would burn the ships
and slay the Achaian warriors.
703.] Such thoughts were theirs, as they stood
opposed in arms. Then Hektor laid hold upon the
stern of an ocean-going galley, fair and swiftly-leaping,
which bare Protesilaos¹ to Troy, nor brought him back
to his fatherland. It was about his ship that Achaians
and Trojans made havoc of one another, in close conflict;
nor waited they any more the flight of arrows or of
javelins, apart; but, standing anigh one another, with
one mind and heart they plied sharp axes and hatchets
in the fray, and huge swords and twin-pointed spears.
And many a goodly sword, their hilts bound with iron
bands, fell to earth, some from the hands, some from the
shoulders, of fighting warriors; and the black earth ran
with blood.
And when Hektor had laid hold of the ship by the
stern, he let not go the ensign', which he grasped with
his hands, but rallied the men of Troy :-

Argives with added zeal. Aias might no longer hold his
ground, for he was sore put to it by reason of the missiles.
Rather he gave way a little space,-deeming death was
nigh, to the seven-foot gangway', and left the decks of
the well-balanced ship. There, I wot, stood he at bay,
and ever with his sword would keep from the ships what
Trojan soever should bring the unwearying flames; and
evermore, with shouting terrific, would he hearten the
Danaoi :-
'Friends, Danaan heroes, henchmen of Ares, quit you
like men, dear hearts, and bethink you of impetuous
strength! deem we that there be comrades in our rear, or
some stouter wall, to save our warriors from destruc-
tion? No city have we anigh, furnished with towers,
whereby to fend ourselves, manned with a garrison to
turn the scale of war. Nay, but on the plain of the close-
mailed Trojans, leaning upon the sea, we bide far from
our fatherland. Wherefore in our good right hands
lieth all our safety, not in lukewarm conflict.'

THE DEEDS OF PATROKLOS
Patroklos, by Nestor's advice, intercedes for the Greeks with
Achilles, who lends him his armour. Achilles consents, after first
enjoining on him to take no part in hostile pursuit. He offers
a libation for the success of his friend; after which Patroklos leads
out the Murmidons to war, fifty from each of the fifty ships of
Achilles. In the guise of Achilles, Patroklos takes the field, and
drives the Trojans from the ships. Sarpedon is slain by Patroklos,
despite the reluctance of Zeus, who sends Apollo to rescue the body
of his son. Patroklos, forgetful of Achilles' command, pursues the
enemy to the city; he is stunned by Apollo, wounded by Euphorbos,
and finally slain by Hektor.
SCENE:-First the tent of Achilles; then the open field.

1 The SIXTEENTH BOOK is not only one of the most splendid, but also
one of the most important, in the Iliad, because it constitutes the
pivot on which the plot of the great poem hinges. A new turn is
given to events; new combinations are brought about; a change is
introduced into the whole position and circumstances of the hero,
Achilles. It is the intervention of Patroklos that saves the Greeks at
the psychological moment; it is his death that ends the wrath of
Achilles, which is forgotten in the stronger passion of grief for his
slain friend. (Partly from Monro.)

poureth its dusky flood'. And when godlike Achilles, swift
of foot, beheld him, he was moved with compassion, and
spake winged words :-
'Why bathed in tears, Patroklos, like a maiden,
a mere child, that, running beside her mother, crieth to
be taken up, clinging to her robe the while, and
hindereth her quick step, and gazeth upon her with
tearful eyes, till she be taken up? Like such an one,
Patroklos, thou droppest tender tears. Hast thou aught
to tell to the Murmidons, or to me? or hast thou heard
news from Phthie, known to thyself alone? They say
that Menoitios, Aktor's son, is yet alive; and Peleus, son
of Aiakos, liveth yet among the Murmidons; whose
deaths indeed would crave our tears 2. Or dost thou
grieve over the Argives, in that they are perishing round
their hollow ships, all because of their own trespass?
Speak out; hide it not in thine heart; that we may both
know.'
20.] With heavy groaning Patroklos, the knight, made
answer:-
'O Achilles, son of Peleus, thou noblest of the
Achaians, nurse not thine anger; so great a sorrow
constraineth the Achaians. For all that were aforetime
their bravest and best now lie, stricken and wounded, at
the ships. Stricken is the son of Tudeus, mighty
Diomed; wounded is Odusseus of the famed spear, and
Agamemnon; and Eurupulos hath been struck by an

arrow in the thigh. About them the leeches, masters of
many a charm, are busy, healing their wounds: but
thou, Achilles, bidest implacable. Never be it mine to
conceive such anger as thou dost cherish, curst in thy
valour! How shall an after generation profit by thee, if
thou ward not from the Argives shameful destruction?
Ah, pitiless, no father of thine was he we deemed thy
father, Peleus the Knight; nor was Thetis thy mother;
rather the grey sea bare thee, and the steep cliffs,
seeing thy heart is merciless'. But if in thy mind thou
shrinkest from some divine warning, which Zeus hath
revealed unto thee by thy goddess mother, do thou at
least send forth me speedily, and give unto me thy
Murmidons beside, if haply I may become a light unto
the Danaoi. Grant me to wear upon my shoulders thy
harness, that so the Trojans, likening me to thee, may
forsake war, and the martial sons of Achaia have a res-
pite from their toils; yea, but a little breathing-space
sufficeth. Easily may we, fresh and unwearied, drive
back to their city, from ships and tents, men wearied
with the fray.'

was fated to invoke upon his own head fell death and
doom.

Greatly incensed, Achilles spake unto him on this
wise:-
'Ah me, what words are these, Zeus-descended Patro-
klos! I reck not of any prophetic warning, though
known; nor hath my noble mother revealed me aught
from Zeus; but sore the grief that cometh to heart and
mind, whensoever a man who chanceth to stand first
in power is fain to rob one that is his peer, and take
away his prize: this is my sore grief, this my bitter
pain. The woman whom the sons of the Achaians
chose out to be my prize, the captive of my spear after
that I had sacked a well-walled city¹, her hath the son
of Atreus, Agamemnon the King, reft from my hands,
as though I were some despised sojourner2. Howbeit,
we will let the past be past; methinks it is not possible
to cherish wrath in the heart continually. And yet I
said that I would never cause mine anger to cease, or
ever the shouting and the battle were come to mine own
ships. Do thou, then, don my glorious harness upon
thy shoulders, and captain the war-loving Murmidons to
battle, since now a dusky cloud of Trojans hath com-
passed the ships imperiously, and the Argives lean upon
the sea-strand, still pent within a scanty limit; and the
whole town of Troy hath come out against them, full of
confidence, for they behold not my morion's front flash-
ing anigh. Nay, soon would they in their flight fill the
gullies with dead bodies, were Agamemnon the prince

but kindly affectioned toward me; but now are they
besetting our hosts on every side.
74.] For not in the hands of Diomed, son of Tudeus,
rageth unchecked the spear¹ to fend destruction from
the Danaoi; not yet have I heard the voice of Atreus'
son uttered from his detested head; only the voice of
man-slaying Hektor, urging on the Trojans, breaketh in
upon me from all sides, while they with triumphant
cries possess all the plain, vanquishing the Achaians.
Yet even so, Patroklos, fend destruction from the ships
and fall upon them mightily, lest they burn the ships
with flaming fire, and rob us of our dear home-coming.
But hearken unto me: lo, I will put in thine heart the
sum of my behest, that so thou mayest win me great
honour and renown at the hands of all the Danaoi, and
that they may restore unto me the beauteous damsel,
and provide glorious gifts. Drive the enemy from the
ships, and come again; and if the loud-thundering
spouse of Hera grant thee the guerdon of renown, be
not thou ambitious-apart from me-to do battle with
the warrior hosts of Troy; that were to minish my
recompense; nor do thou, exulting in the lust of war,
and with slaughter of the Trojans, lead on to Ilion,
lest haply some immortal god hail from Olumpos
to mix in the fray;-for far-darting Apollo loveth
them right well;-rather turn back, whensoever thou
hast set a light before the Danaoi at their ships,

of Achilles only an instance of his selfishness; he would readily
sacrifice his friend's glory for his own. But is it not possible that
Achilles was led to make the suggestion because he had some
prophetic misgiving as to the ultimate fate of Patroklos?

in any wise could he fetch his breath; and everywhere
trouble followed hard upon trouble'.
112.] Tell me now, ye Muses, that dwell in Olumpos,
how first fire fell upon the Achaian ships. Hektor drew
nigh, and with huge sword smote the ashen spear of
Aias, behind the head where the shaft endeth, and
smote it in twain. The spear indeed Aias, son of
Telamon, still brandished in his hands,-vainly, for it
was but a headless lance, and far from it the bronze
point fell clanging upon the earth. And Aias perceived
in his blameless heart the work of heaven, and quaked;
high-thundering Zeus was utterly confounding all his
counsels of war, and willing victory to the Trojans.
Out of range he drew; then did the Trojans cast un-
wearying fire upon the swift ship, and straightway flame
unquenchable was spread thereon.

Achilles smote upon his thighs and hailed Patroklos :-

'Get thee up, Zeus-descended Patroklos, urger of
steeds! Of a truth I behold among the ships the swift
speed of devouring fire. Peradventure they will seize
the ships and there be no escape. Make no long tarry-
ing; set harness upon thee; and I shall arouse the folk.'

in flashing bronze. First about his legs he set greaves
fair and deftly-fitted with silver clips; next he donned
the breastplate of swift-footed Achilles', richly wrought,

and shining like a star. Upon his shoulders he slung
a silver-studded sword, fashioned out of bronze; and
after that a huge and sturdy targe; upon his mighty
head he fixed a goodly helm, with crest of horse-hair,
whereof the plume waved fearsome above his brow. A
brace of doughty spears he took, fitted to his grasp.
Only the spear of blameless Achilles he took not, heavy,
huge, and stout; this none other of the Achaians could
wield, but only Achilles¹ knew how to poise it,—an ash
from Pelion which Cheiron aforetime had given to his
sire, felled from Pelion's top, to be the bane of heroes.
Then bade he Automedon yoke his steeds swiftly, the
man whom, next after Achilles, the slayer of men, he
honoured most; trustiest in battle he to bide the noise of
conflict. For him accordingly did Automedon yoke the
swift steeds, Xanthos and Balios, that flew fast as the
winds, whom stormy Podarge, grazing in a meadow beside
the Ocean stream, bare to Zephuros, the West-wind".
And by their side³ he harnessed matchless Pedasos, whom
Achilles bore away after the capture of Eëtion's city;
he, a mortal, played his part with immortal steeds.

dear to Zeus, brought his host to Troy; and in each sat

whom he trusted, had he set to be their captains; and
he himself ruled all with princely authority. Of the first
company Menesthios, of the gleaming mail, was chief, son
of the river Spercheios, fed by rain from heaven; him

child of a maiden's love; Polumêlê, beautiful in the dance,
was his mother, daughter she of Phulas; for the mighty
god, the swift-appearer, loved her, when with his eyes
he beheld her among the women that sang and danced
in the dance of clear-voiced Artemis, huntress queen.
Straightway gracious Hermes went up to her chamber,
and lay privily beside her, and gat her a goodly son,
Eudoros, swift of foot, strong in battle. And it was so
when Eileithuia, goddess of childbed, brought him to
the light, and he beheld the shining sun, that mighty
Echekles, Aktor's son, took her to his home, after that
he had provided an ample bride-price; but the child her
aged father Phulas reared and cherished, loving him as
though he were his very son. The third company

excelled all the Murmidons in doing battle with the
spear,-next after the comrade¹ of Achilles. Of the
fourth company Phoinix, the aged knight, was leader; and
of the fifth Alkimedon, blameless son of Laërtes. Now
when Achilles had stationed them all, with their captains,
in due order, he spake a mighty word :-
"

threats, which ye uttered against the Trojans at the
swift ships during the time of mine anger, and upbraided
me, each one, saying: "Fierce son of Peleus, surely thy
mother suckled thee with gall; ruthless thou art, in that
thou keepest thy comrades, all unwilling, by the ships;
home let us return with our ocean-faring craft, seeing
that thus black choler hath descended upon thy soul."
Oft, gathering yourselves together, would ye speak me
thus; and now is set before you a mighty work of war,
1 Patroklos.

for the which aforetime ye craved. Wherefore let each
man fight against Troy with a good heart!'
210.] With such words did Achilles arouse fresh
might and courage in each; and the ranks were massed
the closer, when they heard their king. As when
a man buildeth the wall of some lofty dwelling with
stones close-set, to foil the force of the winds: so closely
massed were helms and bossy targes. Targe pressed
hard on targe, helm on helm, warrior on warrior; while,
as they bent their heads, their horse-plumed helms
touched with bright crests: so close stood they to one
another¹. In the forefront of all before the Murmidons,
two men were donning their harness for battle, Patroklos
and Automedon; and one mind possessed the twain.
220.] But Achilles hied him to his tent, and raised the
lid of the fair carven chest which silver-footed Thetis
gave him to take aboard his ship, well filling it with
tunics, and cloaks to shield him from the wind, and
fleecy rugs. Therein, too, was a chased goblet, from the
which no man drank gleaming wine; nor did he pour
libations to any god therefrom, save to father Zeus alone.
This he took from the chest, and cleansed it first with
sulphur, then washed it with sweet streams of water,
and washed his hands, and drew therein a draught
of gleaming wine. Then, standing in the midst of the
forecourt, he prayed, and poured forth wine, with eyes
turned heavenward; and Zeus, that wieldeth the
thunder, hearkened :-

prophets', that couch, with unwashen feet, upon the

now also fulfil this desire of my heart. For I myself
will abide where the ships are gathered, but my comrade
I do send unto battle, companied with many Murmidons;

Zeus hearkened unto him. One half he granted, the
other he denied; he suffered Patroklos to drive the war
and battle from the ships, but to return from the battle
he suffered not?.
And it came to pass, when he had poured libations

and made prayer to father Zeus, that Achilles went back
into the tent, and replaced the goblet in the chest, and
came and stood before the tent; for even yet¹ he desired
amain to witness the fierce combat of Trojans and
Achaians. Now these had donned their harness and
were marching with Patroklos, till, trusting in their
might, they swooped upon the Trojans. All in a
moment poured they forth, like wayside wasps which
boys, as is their wont, provoke, for very mischief²; lo,
the insects work a common harm to many; for even if
some wayfaring man, passing by that way, do, all
unwitting, stir them, they-so stout their temper-fly all
abroad, defending their brood: such was the mood and
spirit of the Murmidons, as forth from the ships they
poured; and clamour unquenchable arose.
268.] Then, with a mighty shout, Patroklos cried
aloud unto his comrades :-
'Murmidons, comrades of Achilles son of Peleus, quit
you like men, my friends, and forget not impetuous
valour, that we may bring honour to Peleus' son, him
who is bravest of all Argives beside their ships,—aye,
and whose followers are bravest also,-and that the son
of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, may understand
what folly was his, in the day that he slighted the
bravest of Achaia's sons.'

spirit of each. Upon the Trojans they fell, in a body;
and, round about, the ships resounded terribly to the

noise of shouting Achaians. But when the Trojans
perceived the valorous son of Menoitios, both himself
and his squire gleaming in arms, the hearts of all were
shaken, and their serried ranks were moved, for they
supposed that swift-footed Achilles had cast aside his
anger,—there, beside the ships,—and had chosen amity
in place thereof; and each man cast his eyes about to
see how he might escape fell death.
284.] Patroklos was first to launch a glittering spear
full into their midst, where the throng was densest,
close beside the ship of high-hearted Protesilaos; and
he struck Puraichmes, who led the horse-plumed¹
Paionians from Amudon, that standeth by the banks of
wide-flowing Axios. Him he smote upon the right
shoulder; and with a loud cry backward fell he in the
dust; and the Paionians, his comrades, trembled for
fear; for Patroklos struck terror into all, by the slaughter
of their leader that excelled in battle. From the ships
he drave them, and quenched the flaming fire. Now it
was so that the ship was left there half burnt; and the
Trojans fled in dire confusion, while the Danaoi poured
forth among the hollow ships; and ceaseless was the
tumult wrought. As when from the lofty ridge of some
huge hill Zeus, the lightning-gatherer, lifteth the cloud
veil; and, on a sudden, all the crags and jutting pro-
montories and glens shine forth, and from the height

Danaoi, when now they had thrust from the ships their
foemen's fire, found a little breathing-space. Howbeit
the end of battle was not yet; for not yet were the
Trojans driven in headlong rout¹' from the black ships
by the Achaians; still did they make a stand, though
perforce retiring from the ships.
306.] Then, as the battle betwixt the chieftains
broadened out, man slew man,-Menoitios' doughty son
the first, just as Areïlochos turned away; he struck him
with keen-edged spear upon the thigh, and drave the
bronze therethrough; the spear brake the bone, and
prone he fell to earth. Next warlike Menelaos wounded
Thoas2 upon the breast, where the shield guarded him
not, and loosed his limbs in death. And the son of
Phuleus, lying in wait for Amphiklos as he rushed
upon him, was foremost in striking him upon the thigh,
where a man's muscle is thickest; and round the
spear point the tendons were severed; and darkness
veiled his eyes*.
Antilochos, Nestor's son, wounded Atumnios with
sharp spear, and thrust the bronze weapon through his
side; and he fell upon his face. But Maris, angered
Cleared of the wrack that hung on it before,

for his brother, leaped upon Antilochos with his
spear, and grappled, standing before the dead; but, or
ever Maris could strike home, godlike Thrasumedes,
brother to Antilochos, was swift to deal a blow (nor
missed his aim) full upon the shoulder; and the spear's
point reft the flesh of his arm from the muscles, and
brake utterly¹ the bone. With a clash he fell; and
darkness veiled his eyes.
326.] So went they down into the shadows, twain
brothers smitten by brothers twain, even Sarpedon's
goodly comrades, warriors that hurl the javelin, sons
of Amisodaros who (I wis) nurtured Chimaira of mon-
strous bulk, to be a grievous bane unto many.
And Aias, son of Oïleus, sprang upon Kleoboulos
and took him alive, for he was tangled in the press;
then with hilted sword did Aias smite him on the neck,
and unbend his might. And all the sword was 'warm
with blood; and dark death and over-mastering fate laid
hold upon his eyes. Then did Peneleôs and Lukôn
rush together; howbeit, seeing they had missed each
other with their spears, and bootless were their castings,
they fell upon each other with the sword. Whereupon
Lukôn struck at the crest of the horse-plumed helm,
but the sword was snapped asunder at the hilt; and
Peneleôs smote Lukôn upon the neck, beneath the ear,
and all the blade went in, and only the skin held fast;
while the head hung down at the side, and his limbs
were loosed from under him.
And Meriones, overtaking Akamas with swift feet,
thrust him in the right shoulder as he mounted his
chariot; down fell he, and a mist was shed abroad upon

his eyes. Then Idomeneus with pitiless bronze struck
Erumas upon the mouth; and the bronzen point pierced
from below under the brain, and shattered the white
bones; and the teeth were unsocketed, and both his
eyes were filled with blood; and, with a gasp, he blew'
forth the blood through mouth and nostrils; and death's
black cloud compassed him about.
351.] Thus, I trow, did these chieftains of the Danaoi
slay each a man. As ravening wolves beset lambs or
kids, lifting them from their dams, what time, by the
shepherd's folly, they are scattered upon the hills; the
wolves, soon as they descry their prey, rend them.
forthwith-poor timorous victims: so did the Danaoi
beset the Trojans, who bethought them only of clamor-
ous flight, and forgat their high courage.
358.] And evermore did Aias, the mighty', seek to
launch his shaft against bronze-mailed Hektor; but he
(such his warrior cunning), his ample shoulders covered
with a bull's-hide shield, kept watch for the whistling of
arrows and the clash of spears. Well indeed he knew
the turn of victory's tide; but yet scatheless so endured,
striving to succour his trusty comrades.

The point of the comparison is not very obvious. Note: the cloud
comes 'from Olumpos' because Zeus, who dwells there, sends it; it
comes across the sky (or 'firmament') because that is the background
where the cloud-movements are seen (see Leaf, vol. ii, Appendix H).

cries out of the ships, and in disordered rout passed
over. But as for Hektor, him in all his panoply were
the swift horses bearing far away; and the Trojan folk
was he leaving behind, held back-sore against their
will-by the deep moat. And the swift steeds that
drew the chariot of many¹ a chieftain brake short the
pole, and left the chariot on the ground.
But Patroklos, vehemently urging the Danaoi, pressed
hard on, devising mischief for the Trojans; they in
clamorous flight cumbered all the tracks, for they were
scattered; and a cloud of dust was whirled up to the
clouds, while the stout-hooved steeds were galloping
cityward from ships and tents. And wheresoever
Patroklos marked the people gathering densest, thither
he bent his way, with a shout; and the fighters kept
falling headlong from the chariots beneath the axles,
and the chariots were overturned with a hollow noise.
Full across the moat flew the immortal steeds, ever
straining forward; and it was against Hektor that
Patroklos yearned to go; for he was eager to strike
him; but the swift steeds carried him away.
And as, beneath a tempest, the whole swart land is
overcharged in time of autumn, when Zeus poureth
down a blustering deluge, what time his wrath is
kindled against men who, in the mart, give crooked

the torrents' roaring to the purple sea as headlong they
plunge from the mountains; and the works of men's
hands are minished: even so the Trojan steeds groaned
mightily as they ran.

of the foremost ranks, back to the ships he drave them.
and hemmed them round, nor, for all their desire,
suffered he them to set foot in the city; but, midmost
the ships and river and the lofty wall', he leaped upon
and slew them, and requited vengeance for many.
There first he smote Pronoös with shining spear upon
the breast, where the shield guarded him not, and
loosened his limbs in death; with a crash he fell.
Next he rushed against Thestor, son of Enops; he on

and the reins had dropped from his hands. And Patro-

and dragged him by the spear over the chariot-rail. As
when an angler, sitting on some jutting rock, draweth a
lusty¹ fish home to land from the deep, with line and
glittering bronze: even so did Patroklos with shining
spear drag Thestor, gasping, from the car, and cast him
down upon his mouth; and life forsook him when he
fell.
411.] Then with a stone he smote Erualos, as on
he swept, full in the centre of his head; and all the
head was cloven asunder in the heavy casque; prone
on the ground he fell; and Death the destroyer com-
passed him about. Next he slew Erumas, and Am-
photeros, and Epaltes, and Tlepolemos son of Damastor,
and Echios, and Puris, and Ipheus, and Euippos, and
Polumelos son of Argeas; these, one after another, he
laid low on the nursing earth.
419.] Now it came to pass, when Sarpedon' beheld
his ungirdled comrades stricken by the hands of
Patroklos, son of Menoitios, that he called aloud upon
his goodly Lukioi, chiding them :—
"Shame, ye Lukioi! whither do ye flee? Now are ye
brisk, in sooth! Lo, I will meet yonder man, that I

There are three fishing-similes in Homer-here, in xxiv. 81, and

with the present one.
2 We come here to the celebrated episode of the feats, and fate, of
Sarpedon. Seeing the dire distress of his comrades, Sarpedon rallies
his men, and goes forth to meet Patroklos. (Cf. Murray, Rise of the
Greek Epic², pp. 230, 231.) Sarpedon's fall marks the culmination of
Patroklos' success.

may know who he is that is so mighty, and hath already
wrought much havoc upon the Trojans, seeing he hath
loosed the limbs of so many a stalwart.'
With that he leapt down to earth from his chariot,
accoutred for battle. And on the other side Patro-
klos, soon as he marked him, leapt from the car. As
two gier-eagles, with crooked talons, and hooked beaks,
battle on some tall crag, uttering loud screams: so did
those heroes rush upon each other with loud cries.
431.] And the son of crooked-counselling Kronos,
when he saw them, pitied them, and thus he spake to
Hera, his spouse and sister:-
'Woe is me, seeing that it is fated that Sarpedon,
my beloved son, die at the hands of Patroklos, son of
Menoitios. My heart is divided within me as I muse
whether I shall snatch him away alive far from tearful
battle and set him down in the fat pastures of Lukiê;
or whether I shall now suffer him to be overcome at the
hands of Menoitios' son.'
Then did Hera, mild-eyed queen, make reply:-
'Dread son of Kronos, what is this thou hast
spoken? art thou fain to loose from ill-sounding death
man that is mortal, long since foredoomed to die?
So do; but we, the rest of the gods, shall praise thee
not. Howbeit, I will speak unto thee, and do thou
consider it well. If thou send Sarpedon alive to his
home, bethink thee that, hereafter, some other god may

vague theologies of polytheism. Cf. Adamn, The Religious Teachers

be minded to send his son from the fierce combat; for
the sons of the Immortals warring around Priam's
mighty city are many, in whom thou wilt plant bitter
jealousy. But if he is dear unto thee, and thy heart
lamenteth because of him, suffer him to be slain in the
fierce combat by the hands of Patroklos, son of Menoi-
tios; and when at last life and breath have forsaken
him, send Death and deep Sleep to bear him hence, till
they reach broad Lukiê's champaign; there his brethren
and kinsmen will give him burial with sepulchre and
pillar¹; for such is the guerdon of the dead.'
458.] Thus spake she; and the father of gods and
men hearkened; and let fall to earth drops of blood',
honouring his son, whom Patroklos was destined to
slay in fertile Troy, far from his fatherland.
462.] Now when they were nigh unto each other³,
...
1 Cf. 2 Kings xviii. 18 (=2 Sam. xviii. 18) LXX: 'Now Absalom
in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar (Tηv
orýλŋv) . . . and it is called Absalom's monument unto this day.'
The indications both in this O. T. passage, and in Homer, are in
favour of the worship of the dead, as the motive for erecting such
a monument. The word rapxúσovσι indicates 'embalming'; and it is
not unfair to conjecture that burial with partial mummification was
familiar to the poet as well as cremation, though the former custom
was older. The Lycians' care for their dead is attested to this day
by the tombs at Xanthos. It may be noticed that the practice of
embalming was closely connected with the idea of resurrection; in
Egyptian religion it was certainly based upon the notion of the
prolongation by this means of the soul's life (Frazer, Golden Bough³,
'The Dying God,' p. 4). For a picture of a σrýλŋ see Hill, Illustra-
tions of School Classics, 354 (from a fifth-century Greek vase).

then in sooth Patroklos smote renowned Thrasudemos,
who was prince Sarpedon's faithful henchman,-smote
him in the pit of the belly, and loosened his limbs. Then
did Sarpedon leap against him with flashing spear,
but missed; yet with his weapon he wounded Pedasos,
the horse', on the right shoulder; down he crashed,
gasping out his life; and he lay in the dust screaming,
and the life fled away. Then wheeled the immortal
steeds apart, and the yoke creaked, and the reins were
tangled together, since the trace-horse lay in the dust.
But for this confusion spear-famed Automedon found an
end; he drew the long sword from his stalwart thigh;
then, with swift movement, cut adrift the trace-horse,
nor lagged; and the horses twain righted themselves,
and pulled at the reins, while the two warriors closed
once more in mortal combat.

477-] Yet once more did Sarpedon miss Patroklos
with gleaming spear; over his left shoulder flew the
point thereof, nor grazed him; and straightway Patroklos
rushed forward with the bronze; and not in vain did
the shaft escape out of his hand, but smote his adversary
just where the midriff fences the throbbing heart. And
he fell, as when some oak falleth, poplar or lofty pine,
which, upon the hills, with axes newly whetted, ship-
wrights hew for timber: so he, outstretched before
chariot and steeds, lay moaning, clutching the gory
dust. As when a lion, coming upon a herd, slayeth a

bull, huge and fierce', amid the shambling kine; bel-
lowing, it yieldeth up its life, slain by the lion's fangs :
even so the chieftain of the shielded Lukioi fell before
Patroklos; but, dying, struggled with his fate, and
called upon his loved comrade :-
:-
492.] 'Glaukos, my friend, thou soldier among men,
now must thou show thyself a spearman indeed, and a
warrior undaunted; now be fell war thy desire, if thou
art swift to fight. First, go to and fro everywhere and urge
the captains of my Lukioi to fight round Sarpedon³;
and do thou thyself fight about me with the bronze.
For a cause of sorrow and of shame were I unto thee
all the days of thy life, if the Achaians spoil me of my
harness, fallen as I am at the gathering of the ships.
Nay, hold thy ground sturdily, and urge on all the
folk.'
501.] Scarce had he spoken when death muffled his
eyes and nostrils; while Patroklos, standing with his
feet upon the dead man's breast, plucked the spear from
his flesh, and the midriff followed the passage thereof;
from him he drew forth life and spear-head together.
Then did the Murmidons hold fast there the snorting
steeds, eager to flee away now that the hand which
guided the chariot was gone*.

2 He died 'game', as we should say. His rage and resentment
against his untimely fate were manifested in his last moments.

508.] Then did bitter anguish come upon Glaukos, as
he heard that utterance; and his spirit waxed hot within
him, seeing he could not help. With his hand he seized
his arm, and pressed it hard; for the wound vexed him
grievously, which Teukros had dealt him as he sprang
upon the lofty wall, fending doom from his comrades.
And he prayed to far-shooting Apollo :---
'Hear me, O King, thou who art somewhere in Lukie's
rich land, or in Troy; thou canst in all places give ear
unto a man in his grief, even as now I am grieved. For
I am sore wounded, and my hand is pierced every way
with sharp pains, nor can the blood be staunched, but, by
reason of the wound, my shoulder is tormented; and my
spear I cannot hold firm, nor do battle with mine enemies.
And the bravest of the brave is fallen, even Sarpedon,
son of Zeus; but Zeus succoureth not even his own son.
Now, therefore, O Lord, heal thou (I beseech thee) this
grievous wound, and assuage my pangs, and give me
strength, that I may comfort my friends the Lukioi, and
hearten them for battle, and myself fight on behalf of
Sarpedon slain.’
526.] In such wise prayed he, and Phoibos Apollo
heard him. Straightway he stayed the anguish, and
from the grievous wound dried the dark gore, and put
new strength into his heart. And Glaukos was ware
thereof, and rejoiced because the mighty god had heark-
ened speedily unto his supplication. First, going to and
fro among the Lukian chieftains, he urged them to do
battle around Sarpedon; next, with huge strides, went
he in quest of the Trojans-Pouludamas, Panthoös and
godlike Agenor-and sought out Aineias, and Hektor

of the brazen helm. And standing anigh these, he
spake winged words:
'Hektor, now of a truth hast thou utterly forgotten
thine allies who, for thy sake, far from friends and
fatherland, are perishing, while thou art unminded to
help. Low lieth Sarpedon, leader of the shielded
Lukioi, he who defended Lukiê with justice¹ and his
strong right arm; him hath brazen Ares slain with the
spear at the hand of Patroklos. Nay, go to, my friends,
stand by me now; be ye filled with generous shame; lest
they reave his harness from him, and the Murmidons,
wroth for the slaughtered Danaoi-whom with spears
we slew by the swift ships-dishonour his corse.'
548.] He spake, and sorrow-irrepressible, unconquer-
able-laid hold upon the Trojans utterly, seeing that,
alien though he was, Sarpedon was the bulwark of their
city; for many folk had followed him, and among them he
himself was doughtiest in battle. Onward they moved
against the Danaoi, with eager longing; and Hektor cap-
tained them, wroth for Sarpedon. Then did Patroklos,
son of Menoitios, that stalwart heart, rouse the Achaians;
first he addressed the two Aiantes, themselves inflamed
with zeal :-
'Ye two Aiantes, now be it your joy to do valiantly;
prove yourselves as ye were aforetime among men, or
yet mightier. Low lieth the man who was the first to
leap the Achaian wall,-Sarpedon; go to, let us take

562.] So spake he; but they twain were themselves
full eager for the fray. And when both sides had
strengthened their battle-lines-Trojans, and Lukioi,
and Murmidons, and Achaians-then, with a shout
terrific, they met in shock of conflict over the dead.
Sarpedon; and loud clanged the warriors' harness.
And Zeus spread a horror of darkness above the
stubborn strife, that the labour of battle over his beloved
son might prove in vain ¹.
569.] First the Trojans beat back the keen-glancing
Achaians; for there had fallen not the meanest among
the Murmidons, to wit, godlike Epigeus, son of high
hearted Agakles, who lorded it aforetime in Bondeion,
that goodly city; but, after that he had slain a brave
kinsman, he had come as a suppliant to Peleus and sil-
ver-footed Themis; so they sent him with man-slaying
Achilles, to follow in his train to Ilion, land of fair steeds,
that he should fight against Troy. Him, as he touched
the corse, glorious Hektor smote upon the head with a

questioning the authenticity of the passage.

heavy casque; prone on the ground he fell; and Death
the destroyer compassed him about. Then was Patroklos
seized with fury for his comrade's death; right through
the foremost files he bore, like a swift falcon, which
scattereth the daws and starlings' in flight: even so,
Patroklos, driver of steeds, didst thou sweep full upon
Lukioi and Trojans, wroth for thy friend.
And he smote Sthenelaos, Ithaimenes' dear son, with
a huge stone upon the neck, and tare the sinews there-
from; and the champions, and glorious Hektor, gave
ground. Far as the cast of some tapering spear 2, flung

slew high-hearted Bathukles, Chalkon's dear son, who
dwelt in Hellas and excelled among the Murmidons

when Bathukles was close upon him in the chase; with
a crash he fell; and keen anguish laid hold upon the
Achaians, for that a hero had fallen. But the Trojans

armed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonos, Onetor's bold
son, priest of Idaian Zeus, revered as a god by his
people; him he struck beneath jaw and ear; and swiftly
the life fled from his limbs, and loathed darkness seized
him. Next Aineias launched a brazen spear against
Meriones; for he hoped to hit him as on he came under
cover of his shield; but he beheld, and avoided the
brazen death; for he bent low, and the long spear stuck
fast in the ground, and the butt thereof quivered; and
thereupon fierce Ares abated its fury.
Then was Aineias wroth, and cried :—
'Ha, Meriones! swiftly had my spear, for all thy
dancing', stayed thee for ever, had it but smitten thee.'
619.] And Meriones, spear-famous hero, thus an-
swered him :-
'Aineias, hard is it for thee, mighty though thou art,
to quench the prowess of all men that face thee in
battle; thou too art mortal. Were I also to strike thee
in the midst with my keen bronze, speedily wouldst thou
give triumph unto me, and thy soul unto Hades of the
famed steeds, doughty though thou art and confident
in thy strength.'
626.] Such his words : but the valiant son of Menoitios
chided him:-
:
'Meriones, why speakest thou in this strain, seeing
thou art brave? Nay, my friend, in no wise will the
Trojans leave the dead for gibing words; sooner will

For in might
of hand lie the issues of war; the issue of words lieth
in counsel¹; wherefore must we bandy no talk, but
fight.'
632.] So saying he led the way, and the godlike hero
followed after. As the noise of woodmen's axes ariseth
among the mountain glens, and the sound thereof cometh
from afar even so rose the clang of fighters from the
wide-wayed earth, clang of mail' and of bull's-hide targes
deftly wrought, as they pierced one another with swords
and two-edged spears. Nor had any wight, for all his
shrewdness, descried godlike Sarpedon, for, from head
to foot, was he wrapped about with darts and blood and
dust. And round his corpse ever pressed the throng,
as when in springtime in the byre flies buzz about the
brimming pails, what time the milk overfloweth the
vessels: so thickly the warriors flocked about Sarpedon's
corpse.

644.] Yet did Zeus never turn away his shining eyes
from the stubborn fray, but always his look was upon
the men; and ofttimes did he muse upon Patroklos'
death, considering whether glorious Hektor should now
with the bronze slay that hero also,-there, over godlike

he deemed it best that the squire of Achilles, son of
Peleus, should at least once again drive back the Trojans.
and bronze-mailed Hektor to the city, and spoil many
a warrior of his life. So Hektor first he filled with
strengthless panic; he gat him into his chariot, and
turned his steed to flight, and summoned the rest of the
Trojans to do likewise; for he marked the sacred scales
of Zeus ¹.
And it was so that the stalwart Lukioi also held not
their ground, but all fled away, when they beheld their
king lying amid the heaps of slain, struck to the heart;
for many a man had fallen upon their lord, in the hour
when Zeus drew tight the cords of stern conflict. Then
did the Achaians strip from Sarpedon's shoulders his
harness of gleaming bronze; and the valorous son of
Menoitios gave them to his comrades to bear unto the
hollow ships.
666.] Then spake cloud-gathering Zeus unto Apollo:-
'Behold now, Phoibos, go; and when thou art out of
range, cleanse the dark gore from Sarpedon; and then,
bearing him afar, wash him in the river streams, and
anoint him with sweet unguent, and wrap him in am-
brosial vestures; and give him the twin gods Sleep and
Death for swift escort, who speedily will lay him in
broad Lukie's pleasant land, where his brethren and

kinsfolk will bury him alike with barrow and with
stone; for such is the guerdon of the dead.'
676.] So spake he; and Apollo hearkened unto his
father, and moved down from Ida's mountain-tops to the
fierce battle and straightway bare divine Sarpedon out
of range, and carried him afar and washed him in the
river streams, and anointed him with sweet unguent,
and wrapt him in ambrosial vestures; and gave him
the twin gods, Sleep and Death, for swift escort, who
speedily set him down in broad Lukiê's pleasant land¹.
683.] But Patroklos, urging on both his steeds and
Automedon, went in pursuit of the Trojans and Lukioi,
-infatuate in his folly! Had he but kept the word of
Achilles, surely he had escaped black death's ill fate.
But evermore the counsel of Zeus is mightier than man's.
Wherefore he filled his breast with passion.
Whom first, whom last, Patroklos, slewedst thou, that
hour when the gods summoned thee to death? Adrastos
first, and Autonoos, and Echeklos, and Perimos son of
Meges, and Epistor, and Melanippos; next Elasos, and
Moulios, and Pulartes: these he slew, and the rest
turned their thoughts to flight, each one.
698.] Then had the sons of Achaia captured Troy,
with its lofty gates, by the might of Patroklos (for with

Apollo stood upon the goodly-fashioned tower, with bale
in his heart against him, and defending the Trojans.
Thrice upon the bend of the high wall clomb Patroklos,
and thrice Apollo thrust him back, striking the glittering
targe with immortal hands. But when, for the fourth
time, Patroklos came on, terrible as a god, then with a
shout terrific did Apollo speak winged words :-
'Avaunt, Zeus-descended Patroklos! it is not destined
that the lovely Trojan city be sacked beneath thy spear,
-no, nor by Achilles, a mightier than thou.'
Thus he spake, and Patroklos withdrew a goodly
space to avoid the wrath of far-shooting Apollo.

thy stout-hooved chargers against Patroklos, if perad-
venture thou mayst slay him, and Apollo grant thee thy
heart's desire ".'
726.] With such words the god backward strode in
to the press of men, and glorious Hektor bade shrewd-
hearted Kebriones whip up his coursers to battle. Then
did Apollo enter the throng, and sent deadly panic among
the Argives, but to the Trojans and to Hektor gave he
glory. As for the rest of the Danaoi, Hektor recked not
of them, nor slew, but set his stout-hooved steeds against
Patroklos. Opposite, Patroklos leapt to earth from his
chariot, a spear in his left hand; with the right he seized
a stone, bright and jagged, fitted to his grasp³. He
flung with all his strength, nor long time stood in dread
of his foeman; the bolt went home; and with that sharp
stone he smote Kebriones, Hektor's charioteer, a bastard
son of renowned Priam, even as he held the chariot reins,
full in the face. And the stone crushed both brows
together, nor did the bone stay the course thereof; and
his eyes fell upon the dust of the earth, there, before his
feet. Even as a diver falls, so fell he from the well-
wrought car, and life forsook his bones.
Him, with a bitter gibe, didst thou, horseman Patroklos,
address:-

the finny deep also, this warrior, leaping from his ship
in quest of oysters, would sate full many, how stormy so-
ever the deep should be; so easily he tumbleth from
chariot to plain. In good sooth, even among the Trojans
there be tumblers.'
751.] With these words he rushed upon Kebriones,
as a lion springeth, who, ravaging the farmsteads, hath
been wounded in the breast, bold to his undoing so
hotly sprangest thou, Patroklos, upon Kebriones. Then
over against him Hektor leapt from his chariot to the
ground. And for Kebriones the twain joined battle, as
on the hill-tops for some slain deer two lions fight, hungry
and fierce at heart: so for Kebriones did those two
chieftains, Patroklos, son of Menoitios, and glorious
Hektor, yearn each to stab the other with pitiless
bronze'. When Hektor grasped the corpse by the head,
he let not go; but over against him Patroklos held it by
the foot; and all the rest, I ween, Trojans and Danaoi,
joined in the stubborn fray. And as the East wind and
the South strive with each other in shaking the bosky
wood in glens of the mountain,-oak, and ash, and

On which they weene their famine to asswage,
And gaine a feastful guerdon of their toyle,
Both falling out doe stirre up strifefull broyle,
And cruell battell twixt themselves doe make,
Whiles neither lets the other touch the soyle,
But either sdeignes with other to partake:
So cruelly these knights strove for that Ladies sake.'

they snap asunder¹: so Trojans and Achaians, springing
upon one another, made slaughter; nor did either
bethink them of deadly flight. And round about
Kebriones was many a sharp spear fixed, and feathered
shafts leaping from the bow-string; and many a ponder-
ous stone smote full upon the shields as they fought
round the dead; but he, mighty amid the whirling dust,
lay mighty in death, his knightly feats forgotten 2.

did the weapons of both sides fly thick, and the people
fell; but when the sun began to move toward evening³,
then, I wis, the Achaians had the vantage, beyond all
hope *. Then drew they stout Kebriones out of range,
far from the Trojan battle-cry; and they reft the harness
from his shoulders; and Patroklos rushed upon the
Trojans, with fierce intent. Thrice he fell upon them,
terrible as Ares, with shout terrific; and thrice he slew

Observe that Homer knows no division of the day into hours; the
'hours' were seasons. Late afternoon was the time for cattle-
loosing: cf. Milton's Comus, 291 sqq. :—
'What time the laboured ox
In his loose traces from the furrow came,
And the swinked hedger at his supper sat.'
Such notation of time is picturesquely pastoral, and there is a pleasing
reminiscence in Virgil, Ecl. ii. 66, 67 :—

Et sol crescentes decedens duplicat umbras.'

thy life's close seen; for Phoibos met him in the stern
encounter, even Phoibos in all his terrors. Yet he
marked him not as he moved through the press; for he
met him, hidden deep in mist; and he stood behind,

the shoulders, with a sharp spear, even Euphorbos son
of Panthoos, who excelled all his fellows whether in
sword-craft, or in horsemanship, or in speed of foot;
for twenty wights he dismounted when first he came to
the war, learning so the art of battle. He it was who
first launched weapon against thee, knightly Patroklos,
yet vanquished thee not; back again he ran, and mingled
with the crowd; from the flesh he plucked that ashen
spear, nor faced Patroklos, all unarmoured though he
was, in deadly conflict. But Patroklos, quelled by the
stroke of the god and by the spear, drew back into the
ranks of his comrades, shunning death.
818.] And it came to pass when Hektor beheld high-
hearted Patroklos retiring, grievously smitten with the
sharp bronze, that he drew nigh unto him amid the
ranks, and wounded him with his lance in the uttermost
flank, and thrust the bronze quite through. With a
crash he fell; and deeply grieved were all the hosts of
Achaia. As when a lion overpowereth an unvanquished
boar, when on the hill-tops the twain do battle in their
pride for some small spring; both are fain to drink;
but now by sheer strength the lion mastereth his foe,
greatly-gasping: even so did Hektor, drawing nigh,
with his spear bereave of life Menoitios' valiant son, spite
the many he had slain. And, exulting above him, he
spake winged words :-

ravage our city indeed, to rob the Trojan women of their
day of freedom and take them in thy galleys home to thy
dear land. Fool that thou wert! to fight on their behalf

the vultures shall feed upon thee. Thou unhappy one!
for all his valour Achilles in no wise availeth, who, biding
behind, did straightly charge thee at thy going forth,
saying: "Come not again, Patroklos, thou that ridest
upon horses, unto the hollow ships, or ever thou cleavest
the coat of murderous Hektor about his breast, dyeing it
in blood." Such his words to thee; and he listened to
thee in thy folly'.'
843.] Him didst thou address, horseman Patroklos,
in feeble accents:-
'Boast thyself now mightily, Hektor! for Zeus and
Apollo have given thee victory, and have easily overcome
me 2; for these be they that reft my harness from my
shoulders. Had twenty such as thou encountered me,
they all would have perished here beneath my might.
But I am slain by disastrous fate at the hand of Leto's
son-and by Euphorbos among men; and now thou
comest, a third, to spoil me. This too will I tell thee,
and do thou ponder it well: not long shall thine own
life be, but of a truth even now death standeth beside
thee, and over-mastering Fate, stricken down by the
hands of Achilles, matchless offspring of Aiakos".
1 'The irony of Hektor's sarcasm, and its falseness, is heightened
when we find the same tone in Achilles' words to Hektor, when he
lies dying . . . In both cases the dramatic effect of the contrast
between the victor's taunt and the solemn prophecy of the dying man
is extraordinarily fine' (Leaf).

stands in solemn contrast with the smallness of man and his efforts.

force. This was peculiarly the case when a father's dying words
were in question : cf. Genesis ix. 25; ib. xlix (Jacob's prevision of his

855.] And when he had ended speaking, death closed
in upon him; and from his limbs his soul sped to Hades,
bewailing his destiny, bereft of manhood and of youth ¹.
Then did Hektor accost him dead on this wise:-
'Patroklos, wherefore forebodest thou of death's terror
unto me? Who knoweth whether Achilles, fair-haired
Thetis' son, may fall not first beneath my lance, his life
cut off?'
With these words he drew the brazen spear from
the wound, his heel against the foeman's breast, and
backward thrust him from the spear-point. Without
ado, grasping his spear, he sped in quest of Automedon,
swift-footed Achilles' godlike henchman; for he was
eager to smite him; but him the swift immortal steeds,
which the gods had given to Peleus,-a glorious prize,—

THE ACTS OF MENELAOS.
Menelaos, marking the death of Patroklos, defends his body;
Euphorbos, in attempting to hinder him, is slain. Hektor's advance
is checked by the united prowess of Aias and Menelaos. Hektor
himself, quickened by the reproaches of Glaukos, renews the battle,
clad in the armour of the dead Patroklos. The horses of Patroklos
bewail the loss of their master. The chariot of Achilles, spite the
efforts of Aineias and Hektor, is borne away by Automedon. Zeus
wraps the body of the fallen hero in dense mist, and, in answer to
the passionate pleading of Aias, scatters the mist, that the combatants
might at least fight in the open day. Menelaos sends Antilochos to
Achilles, bearing news of the death of Patroklos; then, returning to the
fray, in company with Meriones, and succoured by the two Aiantes,
together they carry the dead body of Patroklos back to the ships.
SCENE: The Fields before Troy.
Now Menelaos, Atreus' warrior son, marked that
Patroklos had fallen in battle at the hands of the
Trojans. Through the foremost strode he, clad in
shining bronze, and paced about him, as a young heifer,
till now a stranger to the pangs of motherhood, with
lamentable cry¹ moveth round her first-born calf: even
so paced golden-haired Menelaos about Patroklos.

Before him he held his spear and full-orbed shield,
eager to slay the man that should come forth against
him. Nor did the fall of blameless Patroklos escape the
eye of Panthöos' son', wielder of the ashen spear; close
beside him stood he, and thus accosted Menelaos, whom
Ares loved :-
'O Menelaos, son of Atreus, beloved of heaven, thou
champion of the hosts, give way, leave the dead, and
touch not these bloody spoils 2. For none before me of
Trojans or famed allies smote Patroklos with the spear
in stubborn conflict. Wherefore suffer me to win high
renown among the Trojans, lest I smite thee, and take
from thee thy honeyed life.'
17.] Him did golden-haired Menelaos answer, much
incensed :-
'Father Zeus! verily it is not well to boast arrogantly³.
Methinks neither pard, nor fierce lion, nor baleful wild-
boar-whose mighty heart swelleth high by reason of
the strength within him—are minded as the sons

thy might, if thou stand against me. Nay, but I bid
thee give back and join the throng, not stand and face
me, ere mischief befall. In sooth, the fool learneth
wisdom-too late!¹'
33-] So spake he, unavailingly; and the other made
answer and said :-
Verily this day shalt thou, Menelaos, fostering of
Zeus, pay back the price of my brother's blood, whom
thou didst slay, and over whom thou dost utter proud
words, and madest his wife a widow in her secret
chamber, newly built, causing unspeakable lamentation
and sorrow unto his parents. Surely I might assuage
for them their lamentation and misery, could I bring thy
head and harness and put them into the hands of
Panthöos and of noble Phrontis. But not for long shall
the struggle, whether for life or death, be untried or
unfought.'
43.] With these words he struck his foe upon the
full-orbed shield; howbeit the bronze rent it not, but
the point was bent in the stout targe. Then did Mene-
laos, after prayer unto Zeus his father, rise against him
with the bronze, and, as the foe retired, stabbed him at
the base of the throat, and pressed hard upon him, con-
fident in his heavy hand; and right through the tender
neck came the point. With a crash he fell, and his
armour clattered above him. And his hair, beautiful as

man brace his heart to meet noble Menelaos, face to

Apollo grudged it, who, in the likeness of Mentes, leader
of the Kikônes, hounded on Hektor, swift Ares' peer,
against him; with a loud voice he uttered winged
words :-
'Hektor, now art thou running on a bootless quest,
in pursuit of the steeds of wise-hearted Achilles'; hard
are they for mortal men to break or ride, save for
Achilles, son of an immortal mother. Meanwhile, be it
known unto thee that warlike Menelaos, Atreus' son,
bestrideth Patroklos, and hath slain the bravest of the
Trojans, even Euphorbos, son of Panthöos, and hath
stayed his martial prowess.'

82.] So spake the god, and again moved through the
throng of heroes, clouding Hektor's dark spirit with
dire anguish. Eagerly did Hektor peer among the
ranks, and straightway perceived one stripping off the
famous armour, and the other lying upon the ground;
and blood was oozing from the open wound. He passed
through the foremost, helmed in gleaming bronze, with
a shrill cry, like the quenchless fire of Hephaistos; and
the son of Atreus heard that bitter cry, and, grieved in
mind, thus he spake unto his proud heart :-
:-
'Ah, woe is me! if I leave behind the glorious arms,
and Patroklos who here lieth low for my guerdon's sake',
belike some Danaan, whosoever beholdeth, will be wroth
with me.
But if, biding alone, I do battle with Hektor
and the Trojans, peradventure for very shame, many

will compass me, that am but one; and lo, Hektor is
bringing hither all the men of Troy. But, say, why do
I thus hold parley with myself? Whensoever a man is
minded, in heaven's despite, to do battle with one whom
a god regardeth, swiftly doth a huge wave of calamity
roll in upon him¹. Wherefore none of the Danaoi will
be wroth, whoever beholdeth me yielding before Hektor,
seeing he warreth by aid of heaven. Howbeit if haply
I should find Aias, that bold warrior, then should we
twain come again and recall the joy of combat; even in
heaven's despite, if peradventure we might drag off the
corpse for Achilles, son of Peleus; of evils, that were
the least 2.'
106.] While he mused on these things, behold, the
ranks of Troy came up ; and Hektor led them on. Then
did Menelaos slowly retire, and left the corpse³, turning
round ever and anon to face the foe,-like some bearded
lion whom dogs and men drive from a farmstead with
spears and loud cries; his doughty heart is chilled

within him, yet loth he quitteth the yard: even so moved
golden-haired Menelaos away from Patroklos. Then he
turned him about and halted, when he had reached his
comrades, looking for mighty Aias, Telamon's son.
Him he discerned full soon, on the left of all the fight,
heartening his comrades and urging them to battle; for
Phoibos Apollo had cast into them a dire fear. And
Menelaos ran, and straightway came beside him and
spake :-
'Come hither, Aias, dear heart, let us be up and doing
for Patroklos dead, if so be we may bring him to
Achilles-reft of his gear; his armour is in the hands
of Hektor of the glancing plume.'
123.] He spake, and stirred the spirit of bold Aias.
On through the champions strode he, and with him
golden-haired Menelaos. Now it was so that Hektor,
what time he had stripped Patroklos of his famous.
armour, was dragging him off, to smite his head from
his shoulders with the sharp bronze, and draw the
corpse away, and give it to the dogs of Troy; when,
behold, Aias drew near bearing his tower-like shield.
Then did Hektor withdraw backward into the crowd of
his comrades, and leaped upon his chariot; the fair
armour he handed the Trojans to carry to the city, to
be a great glory unto himself. And Aias, shadowing
the son of Menoitios with his broad shield, stood guard
as a lioness¹ over her whelps, when huntsmen meet her
in the forest, leading her young; but she exulteth in
her strength, and draweth down her wrinkled brow²,

hero, Patroklos. And over against him stood Atreus' son,
Menelaos, whom Ares loved, grief swelling in his heart'.
139.] Then did Glaukos, son of Hippolochos, chief
of Lukiê's chivalry, with stern looks chide Hektor,
bitterly reproachful:-
'Hektor, fairest to look upon, much then dost thou
come short in warfare: all for nought is thy high
renown, thou craven! Bethink thee now thou mayest
save both city and dwelling-place- alone, with the
burghers of Ilion; for none of my Lukioi shall go to fight
for the city against the Danaoi, seeing belike it is a thank-
less task to fight ever staunchly amid a host of foes.
How shouldest thou save even a meaner wight amid the
press, thou pitiless one, now thou hast left Sarpedon-
thy guest and comrade-in-arms alike—to be a spoil and
prey unto the Argives?? Yet, while he lived, he
wrought much good, both to the city and thyself; and
now, thou hast not courage to drive the dogs from him.
Wherefore now, if any Lukian will hearken to me, home
shall we go, and sheer doom will overtake Troy. Were
there this day in the men of Troy high confidence and
strength, unshaken, such as cometh to men who, for
their country's sake, brave toil and combat in the face of
fearful odds, soon enow would we draw Patroklos within
the walls of Troy. And should yonder hero³ come unto
the mighty city of King Priam, albeit in death, and we
carry him from the battle, swiftly would the Argives

whose squire here lieth dead,-mightiest of Argive
heroes beside the ships, he and his close-countering
henchmen alike. But thou, thou hadst no stomach to
stand and face great-hearted Aias, looking him full in the
eyes amid the conflict,-no, nor to fight him, man to
man; for he is of sterner stuff than thou.'
169.] With a scowl, Hektor made reply:-
'Glaukos, wherefore hast thou, being such as thou
art, spoken disdainfully? Out upon it! verily I thought
thou wert wiser than all that dwell in fertile Lukiê.
Yet now I deem thee but a fool, for that thou sayest
I bide not mighty Aias. Know, for a surety, I fear not
the battle, nor the clatter of chariots; but evermore the
will of aegis-bearing Zeus prevaileth, who both maketh
the stalwart to fear, and easily taketh from him the

behold my handiwork 3, whether I shall play the craven

THE ILIAD OF HOMER
With such words Hektor of the glancing plume
avoided out of the fray, and ran, and came unto his
comrades very swiftly-for they were not far off-
following hard upon them on nimble feet; and behold
they were bearing cityward the famous armour of Peleus'
son. And, standing apart from the lamentable war, he
changed the harness; his own he left with the warrior
Trojans to carry to sacred Ilion, but the immortal
armour of Achilles he donned, even the armour which
the High Gods gave unto his dear father¹. Now Peleus
gave it to his son, for he was old; but the son grew not
old in the harness of his father.
198.] When, therefore, cloud-gathering Zeus beheld
Hektor arraying himself apart in the arms of Peleus'
son, he shook his head and spake on this wise to his
own heart
:
'Ah, miserable man, little thou reckest of death, how
nigh unto it thou art; but puttest on the immortal armour
of a mighty hero, before whom others quake. His
comrade hast thou slain,-one that was courteous as he
was brave; and hast stripped his harness from his head
and shoulders, unduly; yet will I, this hour at least,
vouchsafe thee great strength, because, in recompense,
never shalt thou return, for Andromache to receive at
thy hands the famous armour of Peleus' son.'
He spake; and the son of Kronos nodded beneath dark
brows, and fitted the armour to Hektor's body, while dread
Ares, the god of battles, entered into him³, and his limbs
were filled with power and might. Then went he in

quest of his famed allies, with loud cries, and appeared
before them all shining in the armour of Achilles. And
moving in their midst he urged on each,-Mesthles, and
Glaukos, and Medon, and Thersilochos, and Asteropaios,
and Deisenor, and Hippothöos, and Phorkus, and
Chromios, and Ennomos the seer. Unto all these he
spoke winged words, encouraging them :-
220.] 'Give ear, ye myriad clans of allies that dwell
round about! Not because I sought after, nor craved,
a mere host of men, did I call you from your several
homes, but that, with right good will, ye might rescue
the wives and tender children of Troy from before the
war-loving Achaians. To this end do I waste mine own
people with tax of gift and victual, but raise therewith
your courage. Wherefore now let each one turn him
straight onward, and either perish or be saved¹; for
such is the chance of war. And whosoever bringeth
Patroklos, dead though he be, into the midst of the
horse-taming Trojans, and constraineth Aias to yield, to
him shall I give half the spoils, and half shall I retain
myself; and to him shall be like glory as to me.'
233.] Thus he spake; and straight they pressed hard
on against the Danaoi, brandishing their spears; and
hope waxed high within them to drag the corpse from
beneath the feet of Aias, Telamon's son; fools! above
it, where it lay, he robbed full many of their lives.
Then cried Aias unto Menelaos, that warrior bold :-
'Ah, woe is me, Menelaos, thou fosterling of Zeus!
1 Or, return safe (and victorious). Hektor admits that his rule is
somewhat unpopular, and his demands exacting; but he justifies his
action on patriotic grounds.

no more dare I hope that we twain shall return by
ourselves¹ out of the fight. I fear not greatly for the
corpse of Patroklos, which anon shall glut the dogs and
vultures of Troy, as I greatly fear for mine own self,
lest I suffer aught, and for thee, since the war-cloud
wrappeth all about in gloom. But go thou, summon
the Danaan chieftains, if any will hearken.'
246.] Thus he spake, nor did Menelaos, that warrior
brave, disobey, but cried in a loud voice, and accosted
the Danaoi:-
'Friends, leaders and chieftains of the Argives, who,
at the table of Agamemnon and Menelaos, sons of
Atreus, drink of the people's gifts, and severally give
behests unto the folk, and who receive honour and glory
at the hands of Zeus; a hard thing it is for me to watch
what each leader doeth-so great a strife blazeth out.
Howbeit let each man come, unasked, and deem it a
shame that Patroklos become sport for the dogs of
Troy.'
256.] He spake; and swift Aias, Oïleus' son, heard
him clearly, and was the first to face the foe, running
through the battle-throng. And after him came Ido-
meneus, and Meriones, his comrade, peer of Enualios,
slayer of men. But who could tell over unaided¹ the

names of the rest, who, following in their train, awakened
battle among the Achaians?
262.] Close-ranked, the Trojans sped forward, led on
by Hektor. As when, at the outflow of some heaven-fed
river, the huge waves roar against the stream, and the
promontories, on this side and on that, echo again, as
the salt sea is flung back upon the outer beach: with
such uproar moved the Trojans onward'. But the
Achaians stood their ground about the son of Menoitios,
one purpose in their thoughts, screened with their
bronzen shields; and about their glittering helms the
son of Kronos poured dense mist, for he loathed not
the son of Menoitios even aforetime, while he yet lived
and was henchman to the son of Aiakos; and he would
not that he should become a prey to the foemen's dogs;
wherefore he roused his comrades to defend him.
274.] First the Trojans drave back the swift-glancing
Achaians; and they left the corpse, and gave ground,
fearfully; yet did not the high-hearted Trojans slay
a man with their spears, for all their eagerness, but
sought to drag the corpse away. Then were the
Achaians doomed to be severed from that same, but
only for a little space; for Aias rallied them right
speedily,-Aias, who, next after Peleus' blameless son,

surpassed all the other Danaoi in beauty and deeds of
war. Straight through their foremost sped he, in
strength like to some fierce boar that, on the mountain,
turneth to bay and lightly scattereth dogs and lusty
hunters through the glens: so glorious Aias, noble
Telamon's son, following hard upon them, lightly
scattered the ranks of the Trojans who stood about
Patroklos, and were fully minded to drag him to their
city, and win renown.
286.] Now it was so that Hippothöos, glorious son of
Pelasgian Lethos, was dragging the body by the foot
through the stern conflict, and had bound it with a
baldric to the ankle around the sinews, to give joy
unto Hektor and the Trojans; but swiftly fell upon
him a bane which none among them, for all their zeal,
might fend. Him did the son of Telamon, with rapid
rush through the press, smite at close quarters through
the bronzen casque; and the horse-plumed helm was
shattered about the spear-point, and through the vizor¹
gushed from the wound his brain, dashed with blood.
There was his might loosed, and from his hands he let
fall the foot of great-hearted Patroklos to the ground,
where it lay; and, hard by it, he fell prone upon the
corpse, far from rich-pastured Larisse, nor paid he to
his loved parents the price of all their care, but brief
was his life, struck down by the spear of high-souled
Aias 2. Then did Hektor launch a gleaming spear

against Aias; but he marked it, and avoided the bronze
spear, though hardly; but he struck, full beneath the
collar-bone, Schedios, son of high-souled Iphitos, bravest
of all the Phokeans, who had his abode in famous Pan-
opeus, lording it over many men; right through passed
the bronze point, and stuck out at the shoulder's base.
With a crash he fell, and his harness rang above him.
312.] Then Aias smote, full in the belly, wise-hearted
Phorkus, son of Phainops, as he stood defending
Hippothöos, and burst asunder the hollow of the
breastplate, and the bowels gushed out by reason of
the bronze; prone in the dust he fell, clutching the
earth. Then did the champions and glorious Hektor
give ground; and the Argives shouted amain, and
dragged the dead away, even Phorkus and Hippothöos,
and reft the harness from their shoulders.
318.] Then would the Trojans have been forced back
to Ilion by the warrior Achaians, smitten in their
strengthlessness, and the Argives have won renown,
even beyond the doom of Zeus, thanks to their own
power and might; but Apollo himself aroused Aineias;
and appeared in the guise of Periphas the herald, son
of Eputos, who was grown old in his calling before the
face of his aged sire his heart full of gentle thoughts;
likened unto him Apollo, son of Zeus, spake on this
wise :-
'Aineias, how could ye¹ deliver lofty Ilion, in a god's
despite ? Other men have I beheld ere now who put
their trust in their own power and might, in their own
manhood and numbers, holding their realm even in
despite of Zeus. Yet, albeit Zeus willeth the victory

fearful exceedingly, and fight not ¹.'
2
333.] He spake, and Aineias knew that he had
beheld far-shooting Apollo, face to face; and with a
loud cry he called unto Hektor:-
'Hektor, and ye other chieftains of Troy and of the
Allies, now were it a shameful thing to retreat to Ilion,
smitten, in our strengthlessness, by the war-loving
Achaians. Behold even now there stood at my side
a god, who telleth me that Zeus, supreme counsellor of
war, is yet on our side; wherefore let us advance
straight against the foe; nor let them, unmolested,
bring Patroklos to the ships.'
342.] He spake; and, leaping forth far before the
champions, halted; and the Trojans rallied, and faced
the Achaians. Then did Aineias wound with his spear
Leiocritos, son of Arisbas, Lukomedes' brave comrade.
And Lukomedes, whom Ares loved, pitied him when
he fell, and he drew near and stood, and launched
a gleaming spear, and struck Hippasos' son, Apisaon,
shepherd of the folk, in the liver, under the midriff;
and forthwith he loosed his limbs. From fertile
Paioniê had he come, aye and the bravest warrior was
he after Asteropaios. And warlike Asteropaios pitied
him when he fell, and he too thrust forward, eager to
fight with the Danaoi. Howbeit no longer was he able,
for they came and formed a barrier round about
tradition. We thus (as Leaf notes) get the required parallel to vτèp

Patroklos, and held their spears before them. For
Aias went to and fro among all, and straitly charged
them that no man should abandon the dead, and that
none should do battle moving in advance of the other
Achaians, but take their stand hard by Patroklos, and
fight at close range. Such was the bidding of huge
Aias; and the ground was drenched in dark blood, while
corpses fell thick and fast, alike of Trojans, and high-
souled allies, and of Danaoi; for not bloodless was the
fray; yet of them far fewer perished, for ever in the
press they forgat not to ward from one another fell
death.
366.] Thus fought they, like fire; nor could one say
that either sun or moon was unharmed; for, in the
fight, all the bravest, that had stood firm around the
dead Patroklos, were wrapt in mist'. But the rest of
the Trojans and the well-greaved Achaians fought at
their ease beneath the air of heaven, and the sun's light
was spread abroad undimmed, nor was any cloud to be
seen on earth or hills. So they fought on, with times
of rest between 2, and shunned the baleful darts, stand-
ing far off from one another. But they in the midst,
that were the most courageous, suffered grievously by
reason of mist and warfare, and were sore troubled by
the pitiless bronze. Moreover two warriors, heroes
renowned, Thrasumedes and Antilochos, wot not that
blameless Patroklos was dead, but supposed that he

384.] Thus all day long the mighty struggle of fierce
combat was astir; and with the sweat of toil unceasingly
were their knees and legs beneath, and their hands and
eyes, bespattered as the two hosts fought over the brave
henchman of swift-footed Achilles. As when a master
giveth to his men a great bull's hide to stretch, soaked
with fat; they take the skin, and, standing in a ring,
stretch it equally, and straightway the moisture ¹ goeth
out thereof, and the fat entereth in as many tug till all
the hide is stretched every way even so on either side
in brief space the foemen of both hosts tugged amain;
for hope waxed high in the Trojans to drag the body to
Ilion, in the Achaians to the hollow ships. And round
about Patroklos fierce moil was astir; nor could Ares,
that stirreth the folk, nor Athena view such work with
scorn, no, not even though mightily enraged ³.

that Zeus brought to a height that day over Patroklos.
But divine Achilles knew not as yet that Patroklos was
dead; for the fight was far off from the swift ships, under
the Trojan wall. Wherefore he never supposed that he
was dead, but that, having drawn nigh unto the gates,
he would come back alive; nor again did he think at all
that he would sack the city without his aid, no, nor with

mother, who would bring tidings unto him of the will of
great Zeus. But it was so that the grievous calamity.
already accomplished his mother had told him not,-
even that his dearest friend was slain.
412.] But the warriors round the corpse, grasping
their pointed spears, pressed, without ceasing, hard upon
one another, and slew. And thus and thus would some
mailed Achaian cry out :-
'Friends, it were a shame for us to return to the
hollow ships: nay, sooner let the black earth open her
mouth for us!¹ Far better so, forthwith, if we are to
yield this corpse to the horse-taming Trojans to drag to
their own city, and so win renown.'
420.] And on this wise would one of the high-hearted
Trojans made utterance :-
:-
'Friends, if our doom be that we all perish together
beside yonder hero, let not any man retire from the fray.'
So would a man speak, and rouse the mettle of each.

had fallen in the dust at the hand of manslaying Hektor.
Yet many times did Automedon, Diores' brave son,
strike at them with the quick lash; and oft spake to them
with honeyed words, oft with reviling. But they would
not get them back to the ships beside the broad Helles-
pont, nor yet among the Achaians to battle; but even as
a pillar bideth immovable, which is set upon the tomb
of a dead man, or woman, so stood they motionless',
yoked to the fair chariot, with heads bowed earthward.
And hot tears fell from their eyes to the ground as they
made lamentation, yearning for their master; and their
flowing manes were soiled with dust, as they streamed
downward from the cushion' beside the yoke, this side
and that. And, beholding their sorrow, the son of
Kronos had compassion, and he shook his head and
spake unto his own heart :-
'Alas, poor steeds, why did we give you to King
Peleus, a mortal, you that are ageless and immortal?
was it that ye may have griefs among unhappy men?
For verily there is nought anywhere more lamentable
than man among all things that breathe and move upon
Cf. Suetonius, Jul. Caes. 81: 'The verie day next preceeding his
death, those troupes of horses, which, in his (Caesar's) passage over
the river Rubicon, hee had consecrate and let go loose ranging here
and there without a keeper, forbare their meat and would not, to die
for it, touch any; yea, and shed teares abundantly' (Philemon
Holland's version : 1606).

'But like a graven image,
Black Auster kept his place,
And ever wistfully he looked
Into his master's face.'

fastened under the yoke to prevent chafing.

the earth'. Yet of a truth Hektor, son of Priam, shall
not ride upon you and the fair-wrought chariot; for
I shall not suffer it to be so. Is it not enough that he
holdeth the armour, and boasteth himself, as ye see?
Lo, I will put strength in your knees, and courage in
your heart, that ye may bring Automedon safe from the
war unto the hollow ships; for to the Trojans I will
vouchsafe yet more renown,-even to go on slaying
until they be come to the well-benched ships, and the sun
set, and sacred darkness fall.'
456.] So saying, he breathed unto the steeds goodly
strength. They, casting to earth the dust from off their
manes, swiftly drew the rapid car among Trojans and
Achaians. And Automedon did battle against the
Trojans, for he was grieved by reason of his friend 2—
rushing this way and that with the chariot like an eagle
swooping upon geese. With ease he fled from the
Trojan tumult; with ease he swept through the dense
throng in hot pursuit. Howbeit he could not slay the
warriors, as often as he rushed upon them to pursue
them; for he could not, alone in the strong chariot, both
lunge with his spear and drive aright the swift steeds.

466.] Now it came to pass that, at length, a comrade,
even Alkimedon, son of Laerkes, Haimon's son, saw
him; and he stood behind his chariot, and spake unto
Automedon:-
'Automedon, what god hath put into thine heart
profitless counsel, and taken away thy prudence?
Behold, thou warrest against the Trojans in the forefront
of the moil, alone; but in sooth thy comrade is slain,
and Hektor himself weareth the armour of Achilles upon
his shoulders, rejoicing.'
Him then did Automedon, Diorês' son, accost:—
'Alkimedon, who else of the Achaians was able to
guide the steeds, and curb their spirit, save Patroklos
alone, peer of the gods in counsel, while he was yet alive?
But now death and fate compass him. But do thou seize
the lash and the shining reins, and I will get me down
from the chariot to do battle.'
480.] He spake; and Alkimedon leaped upon the
war-chariot¹ and swiftly seized lash and reins, while
Automedon leaped down. And glorious Hektor beheld,
and straightway addressed Aineias, who was hard by:—
'Aineias, thou counsellor of the bronze-mailed Trojans,
I mark yon horses of swift-footed Achilles coming to the
battle with unwarlike drivers 2. These would I fain hope
to capture, if thou at least stand by me,-seeing that
they would not dare to withstand our onset, face to face,
and join issue of battle.'
-
491.] Thus spake Hektor, nor did Anchises' gallant
son disobey. Straight onward went they, their shoulders
covered with bulls'-hide shields, dry and stark, plated

with bronze unstinted. And with them marched Chromios
and Arêtos, fair as a god, both of them together; and
full of hope were they to slay both, and to drive the
arch-necked horses; fools! never should they return,
unbloodied, from Automedon'. He the while made
supplication unto Zeus, and his heart was filled with.
courage and with strength. Straightway he hailed.
Alkimedon, his trusty comrade:-
'Alkimedon, keep not, I pray, thy steeds afar off, but
suffer them to breathe even upon my back; for, methinks,
Hektor, Priam's son, will not stay his fury, till, having
slain us twain, he mount upon the fair-maned steeds of
Achilles, and strike terror into the Argive ranks,—or
himself be slain among the foremost.'
507.] So spake he, and hailed the two Aiantes and
Menelaos :-
:-
'Aiantes twain, leaders of the Argive host, and thou
Menelaos, yield to our bravest the care of the dead, for
them to bestride him and keep far the ranks of foemen:
but do ye avert the pitiless day from us, the living².

516.] He spake, then poised and launched forth a
long-shafted spear, and smote Aretos full on his orbed
shield; but the shield warded not the blow, but through
and through sped the bronze, and in the pit of the belly he¹
drave it through the belt. As when a stalwart man with
keen-edged axe smiteth behind the horns of a bull that
roameththeglebe, and divideth all the sinew; with forward
rush it falleth: even so Aretos rushed forward apace, then
fell upon his back, and the spear, sharp and keen, quivering
in his bowels, loosed his limbs. Then Hektor launched
a shining spear at Automedon; but, quick to mark it, he
shunned the bronzen weapon; for he bowed him down,
and behind him the long shaft stuck fast in the earth, and
the butt thereof trembled; and after that stout Ares
minished its fury. And now had they rushed together
with their swords, had not the Aiantes parted them, spite
of all their zeal, for they hurried through the press at
their comrade's call. And Hektor and Aineias and god-
like Chromios, quaking before them, moved back again
and left Aretos lying where he was, pierced through the

heart'. Then Automedon, swift Ares' peer, rent his
armour from him, and vaunted aloud :—
-
'Verily I have ceased somewhat from anger in my
heart, though the man I have slain is weaker far.'
He spake, and seized the bloody trophies, and set
them in his chariot; then himself gat thereon, his feet
and hands blood-stained above, even as a lion that hath
gorged an ox.
543.] Yet again over Patroklos was stretched the
cord of doughty conflict, harsh, dolorous; and Athena,
coming down from heaven, waked the strife; for far-
seeing Zeus sent her forth to rouse the Danaoi, for so
his purpose shifted'. Lurid as is the rainbow-cloud
that Zeus stretcheth forth from heaven to mortals, boding
war or inclement storm, which stayeth men's labours
upon earth, and distempereth flocks: so lurid the cloud
wherein Athena veiled herself when she plunged amid
the Achaian host, rousing each warrior wight. For she
spake words of encouragement to Atreus' son, stout
Menelaos, who stood anigh; like to Phoinix was she in
form and tireless voice :-
'Verily, Menelaos, to thee shall be shame and disgrace
if swift dogs shall tear noble Achilles' faithful comrade
beneath the wall of Troy. Nay, hold bravely on, and
hearten all the folk.'
Her did brave Menelaos then answer :-

warriors).

'Phoinix, venerable father, would but Athena grant
me strength, and shield me from the stroke of spears!
then would I fain stand beside and defend Patroklos;
for his death hath touched me sore. But Hektor is
terrible as the might of fire, nor doth he cease slaying
with the sword; for to him Zeus giveth renown.'
567.] Thus he spake; and blue-eyed Athena rejoiced,
because that to her, before all gods, he prayed first.
And she gave strength to his shoulders and his knees,
and put in his heart the boldness of a fly¹ which, though
often brushed away from the skin of man, ceaseth not to
bite, for sweet is human blood: with such boldness did
she fill his dark soul, and stood beside Patroklos and
launched a shining spear. Now among the Trojans
was Podes, Eĕtion's son, a rich man and a goodly; and
Hektor honoured him more than any in the community,
inasmuch as he was a beloved friend, and boon-com-
panion. Him fair-haired Menelaos smote in the baldric,
as fast he fled; the point thereof passed through, and
with a clash he fell. But Menelaos, son of Atreus,
dragged the corpse from among the Trojans to where
his comrades stood together.
581.] Then did Apollo draw near, in likeness of
Phainops, son of Asias, who dwelt in Abudos, dearest
of all Hektor's friends. And thus he spake, urging him
on :-
'Hektor, what other Achaian would fear thee now,
seeing thou dost verily cower before Menelaos, who,
aforetime, was a weakling warrior? Behold now he
is gone, having, unaided, lifted a corpse from among the

Trojans; moreover, he hath slain thy faithful comrade,
a valorous champion, even Podes, Eetion's son.'
591.] He spake, and a black cloud of sorrow girt
Hektor about,' and he strode through the foremost,
harnessed in shining mail. Then did the son of Kronos
seize his tasselled aegis, far-glinting, and robed Ida with
clouds; and casting forth his lightnings he thundered
mightily, and the earth quaked. Thus to the Trojans
he promised victory, but the Achaians he affrighted.

597.] Peneleôs, a Boiotian, was the first to beat a
retreat; for, with his face turned ever to the fore, he
had been wounded with a spear in the shoulder, a wound
that grazed the surface; yet did the spear of Pouludamas
pierce through to the bone', for he had smitten him
hard by. Then Hektor wounded Leïtos at close
quarters on the wrist, Leïtos, son of high-hearted
Alektruon, and stayed him from the conflict. Peering
cautiously around, he took to flight, since he could hope
no more, spear in hand, to do battle with the Trojans.
Now it was so that Hektor had started in pursuit of
Leïtos; but Idomeneus struck him upon the corslet, in
the breast close to the pap; howbeit the long spear
snapped at the top of the shaft, and the Trojans shouted
for fear. Then did Hektor make a cast at Idomeneus,
as he stood upon his chariot'; him he missed, though
narrowly, but smote the henchman and charioteer of
Meriones, Koiranos to wit, who had followed his master

from well-built Luktos (for Idomeneus had come¹ on
foot when first he left the rolling ships, and would have
put mighty renown into the hands of the Trojans, had
not Koiranos swiftly driven up his swift-footed steeds;
to Idomeneus he came as a light of salvation, and
fended from him the pitiless day, but himself perished
at the hand of man-slaying Hektor).—Him did Hektor
smite under jaw and ear, and the spear-head dashed out
his teeth, and severed the tongue. Down from the
chariot he fell, and the reins were scattered to earth.
Then did Meriones stoop down and snatch them from
the plain with loving hands, and hailed Idomeneus :-
'Wield now the lash, till thou be come to the swift
ships; thou thyself knowest that victory no longer
declareth for the Achaians.'
624.] He ended, and Idomeneus lashed the fair-
maned steeds onward toward the hollow ships; for
now was fear fallen upon his heart.
Now it was so that great-souled Aias and Menelaos
knew that Zeus was granting the Trojans victory, by
a strength not their own. Then began Telamonian
Aias to speak on this wise :-
'Out upon it! even a simpleton might know now that
father Zeus himself aideth the Trojans. For all their
bolts hit the mark, whosoever launcheth them, be he
bad or good; in any case Zeus directeth them all;
but ours fall idly to earth. But come, let us, of our own

dead', aye and ourselves also by our return give joy to
our comrades. They, I trow, casting their eyes hither,
are sore troubled, deeming that the might of man-slaying
Hektor and his invincible bands will no longer be
stayed, but will fall upon the black ships. Would that
some one of our comrades would take word with all
speed to Achilles, since methinks he hath not heard our
grievous news, that his loved friend is dead. Yet no-
where can I behold such an one among the Achaians;
for they be all, men and horses alike, shrouded in a
cloud 2. O Father Zeus, do thou save the sons of the
Achaians-for thou alone canst-from the cloud; make
open sky, and grant us to behold with our eyes; and,
since thy pleasure is to slay, even slay us-so it be but
in the light!"'

He does not pray for life, for such a petition would have ill beseemed

to no noble end, he chafes at his slackness in the fray and craves
the boon of immediate light, resolved to find a death worthy of his
bravery, even though Zeus should fight in the ranks against him’
(Prof. Roberts's translation). Cf. Keble, Christian Year (Sixth Sunday

Would wish the weary night were gone,
Tho' dawning morn should only show
The secret of their unknown woe;

648.] Thus he spake, and the Father pitied his tears;
straightway he scattered the cloud, and drave the mist
afar, and the sun shone forth, and lo, all the battle
appeared. Then did Aias spake to Menelaos, that
brave warrior :-
'Look now, Zeus-descended Menelaos, if thou canst
discern Antilochos, high-hearted Nestor's son, still alive;
and urge him to go with all speed to warlike Achilles,
and to tell him that his dearest friend is dead'¹.
656.] Thus spake he, and Menelaos, that brave
warrior, hearkened; and he went forth even as a lion
cometh from a steading, awearied of harassing dogs and
men; they, watching all night through, suffer him not
to seize the choicest of their herds; he, lusting after
flesh, chargeth amain, yet accomplisheth naught; for
shafts fly thick and fast from stalwart hands to greet
him, and lighted brands, before which he cowereth for
all his zest; then, with the dawn, he hieth him back, in
sullen anger: even so² Menelaos, that brave warrior,
parted from Patroklos, sore against his will; for much
he dreaded lest the Achaians, for grievous fear, should
leave the prize to the foe. Then straightly he charged
Meriones and the two Aiantes :-
2
'Aiantes, ye chieftains of the Argives, and Meriones,
let now some wight bethink him of the courtesy of ill-
fated Patroklos; for, while he yet lived, it was his way
to be kindly unto all men; but now death and doom
are fallen upon him.'
673.] With such words golden-haired Menelaos
moved away, peering all about like some eagle-

quickest of eye, men say, of all the fowls of the air-
whom, as he saileth on high, the swift-footed hare
escapeth not, couched beneath a full-foliaged bush, but
pouncing down, he seizeth it, and reaveth its life: even
so did thy bright eyes, Zeus-descended Menelaos, turn
this way and that among thy throng of friends, if any-
where they might behold the son of Nestor yet alive'.
Anon he espied him, to the left of all the fray, hearten-
ing his comrades and urging them to battle. Then did
golden-haired Menelaos stand near and speak :-
685.] Antilochos, come hither, thou son of Zeus,
that thou mayest learn lamentable tidings,-ah, would
it were otherwise! Already, methinks, thou knowest
(for thine eyes declare it unto thee) that Heaven rolleth
sorrow upon the Danaoi, while victory belongeth to the
Trojans; Patroklos, noblest of the Achaians, lieth dead,
and bitterly the Danaoi yearn after him. But hie thee
to the Achaian ships, and tell all this speedily to
Achilles; peradventure he will bring this corpse,
though stripped, to his ship; but the armour is in the
hand of Hektor of the glancing helm.'
694.] So spake Menelaos, and horror fell upon Anti-
lochos at the words. Long while he stood speechless,
and his eyes were filled with tears, and sobs choked his
utterance 2. Notwithstanding, he neglected not the
behest of Menelaos, but ran, and gave his armour³ to

his blameless comrade, Laodokos, who, nigh at hand,
was wheeling the firm-hoofed steeds about.
700.] Weeping as he went his way he sped from the
field to bring Achilles, son of Peleus, the ill tidings.
Yet wert thou not fain, Zeus-descended Menelaos, to
help his comrades, now hard pressed, in the place
whence Antilochos had departed, albeit he was sore
missed by the Pulioi. Rather he sent forth goodly
Thrasumedes for their comfort, but himself bestrode
the body of the hero Patroklos, and ran and stood by
the Aiantes, and straightway cried aloud :-
'Antilochos I have sent to the swift ships, that he
should go unto Achilles fleet of foot; howbeit even now
methinks he will not sally forth, spite his grievous wrath
against divine Hektor; for I wist that he may not do
battle against the Trojans, without his harness. Let
us, unaided, devise shrewdest counsel how we may
rescue the dead, and ourselves, far from the clamour
of the Trojans, escape death and fate.'
715.] Then did Aias, Telamon's great son, make
answer :-
'Thou hast said all things well, renowned Menelaos;
but do thou and Meriones shoulder the body with all
speed, and bear it from the tumult; behind, we twain¹
will fight against the Trojans and godlike Hektor,-
one in name 2 and purpose, we that have stood side by
side, facing the edge of war'.
1 The two Aiantes will cover the retreat.

As in this glorious and well-foughten field,

Thus he spake, and they with huge effort raised high
in their arms the dead man from the ground; and,
behind, the Trojan folk yelled when they discerned the
Achaians bearing the corpse. On they charged, like
hounds which dash upon a wounded boar, in front of
the huntsmen; for a while they run, eager to rend
him, but soon as he turneth upon them, trusting in his
might, speedily they get them back, and scatter fearfully
this way and that: even so for a while the Trojans
followed ever in a dense throng, thrusting with swords
and two-handed¹ spears. But when the Aiantes turned
to meet them, and halted, the fashion of their faces
changed, nor did any dare to spring forward and con-
tend for the dead.
735.] Thus with eager haste did the heroes bear the
body from the field of battle to the hollow ships. But
against them the fierce conflict swept like a fire
which, assailing a populous city, blazeth up in a sudden
fury, and the houses are minished and laid low in the
vast conflagration; and, behold, the might of the wind.
roareth upon it amain: even so the measureless
clamour of horses and of warriors fell upon the heroes
as they went their way. As mules that, straining with
utmost strength, drag from the mountain-side adown
a rugged path or beam, or huge ship-timber; and lo,
the spirit within them is worn with labour and sweat, as
they struggle on: with such eager haste the heroes
bare the corpse.

jutting¹ far into the plain, which stemmeth the dolorous
streams of mighty rivers, and causeth the waters there-
of to flow unbroken toward the plain, thrust from their
course; nor, for all their power, can they break it as
they flow: even so the Aiantes ever kept back the
Trojan onset. Yet did the foe follow close, and, chief
among them, Aineias son of Anchises and glorious
Hektor. And as a flock of starlings or daws speedeth,
in full cry, when they behold a falcon coming, that
bringeth destruction to lesser birds: even so, before
Aineias and Hektor, fled the Achaian chivalry, in full
cry, and forgat the fray. And around and on both
sides of the trench were scattered in heaps the goodly
armour of the Danaoi, as they fled; howbeit there was
no rest from war 2.

Homer, says Green, ends this eventful book of fighting with a
collection of images of great force and variety. First the Aiantes
are compared to a fierce boar, scattering the dogs that yelp before
him; next comes the picture of the burning city; then come, in
rapid succession, a series of images: thus, the heroes, as they carry

BOOK XVIII¹
THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES 2.
The news of the death of Patroklos is brought by Antilochos to
Achilles, who utters bitter lamentations, at the sound whereof Thetis
rises from the sea, and comes to her son to comfort him. Meanwhile
the battle still rages over the dead body of Patroklos. Iris, at the
bidding of Hera, appears before Achilles and bids him manifest himself.
His shout, heard far over the trench, dismays the Trojans but heartens
the Greeks who carry the dead Patroklos from the field. Next the
Trojans hold a council of war, and, by advice of Hektor, decide to
remain on the battle-ground. Achilles laments over the fallen
Patroklos. Lastly, Thetis goes to the palace of Hephaistos, the
fire-god, and persuades him to make fresh armour for her son. The
wonderful works of Hephaistos are first described, and finally the
new shield forged, by his art, for Achilles.
1 This book falls into two parts-the effect of the death of Patroklos
on the mind of Achilles, and the story of the forging of new armour
for the Greek hero by Hephaistos. The two parts are connected by
the Thetis episode in its twofold aspect. The resolution of the µîvis
is finally found in the strong motive prompted by grief; the anguish
of Achilles at the loss of his friend is the psychological means whereby
his purpose is broken down. In a moment he lays aside his personal
resentment, and rises up for the final challenge. The claims of love
and friendship prove stronger than his wrath, though, till this instant
of crisis, he had justified to himself the unbending attitude he had
taken up.
The digression on the 'Shield,' though in many ways the most
important section of the book, from the light it throws on early Greek
art, has no dramatic bearing on the theme of the Iliad. It is rather in
the nature of a romantic episode.

the hands of Visvakarma, the architect of the gods: J. C. Oman,
Indian Epics, p. 57.

SCENE: (1) At the tent of Achilles by the sea-shore; (2) the
palace of Hephaistos.
Thus they fought on like a burning fire; but swift-
footed Antilochos came to bring tidings to Achilles.
Him he found before the horned ships, boding in his
mind the things that had indeed been accomplished.
Indignantly spake he on this wise to his mighty heart :-
'Woe is me, why rush the long-haired Achaians
madly over the plain to the ships, discomfited? Belike,
the gods are bringing to pass sore griefs for me, even
as aforetime my mother prophesied; and one foretold
unto me that, while I was yet alive, the bravest of the
Murmidons should die at the hands of the Trojans.
Verily the brave son of Menoitios is indeed dead,
headstrong that he was! and yet I bade him return
to the ships when he had thrust back the foeman's fire,
and not do battle with Hektor.'
15.] While thus he mused within himself, noble
Nestor's son drew near, shedding hot tears, and declared
his grievous tidings:-
'Woe is me, son of wise-hearted Peleus, in sooth right
lamentable tidings thou wilt hear,-would to heaven it
were not so! Low lieth Patroklos, and round his
unarmoured corpse they fight; but the harness is with
Hektor of the glancing helm.'
22.] Thus he spake, and a black cloud of grief
compassed Achilles. With both hands he gathered
ashes¹ and flung them upon his head, and marred his
comely visage; and dark dust hung on his fragrant robe.
1 i. e. ashes of the burnt sacrifice. Before his tent there would be
an altar of Zeus.

But he, huge in his hugeness', lay stretched upon the
dust, and with his hands he tore and ravaged his hair".
And the women-slaves, whom Achilles and Patroklos
had captured in the wars, sorrowing cried aloud, and ran
from the door round about wise-hearted Achilles, and
all beat upon their breasts, and the limbs of each were
loosened. And over against them Antilochos wailed,
letting the tears fall, holding Achilles' hands (while
Achilles groaned in his noble heart), for he feared lest
the hero should slay himself with the sword. Terrible
was his grief; and his august mother heard him, as she
sat in the depth of the salt sea beside her aged father,
and shrieked at the sound thereof; and round her
gathered the goddesses, even all the Nereids that were
in the depth of the salt sea'.
50.] And lo, the silver cavern was filled with them;
and they all did beat upon their breasts together, and
Thetis led the dirge:-

stalwart and without blemish, prince among the mighty
ones! He grew up like a tender plant; I nurtured him
like a tree upon a fruitful hill¹; I sent him forth with the
beaked galleys against Ilion to do battle with the Trojans ;
but him I shall not receive again returning home to the
house of his father Peleus. And while he liveth and
beholdeth the light of the sun, he mourneth, nor can I
succour him by my going. Notwithstanding I will go,
that I may see my beloved son, and hear what grief hath
befallen him that he bideth far from the conflict.'
65.] With such words she left the cave; and with her
went the Nereids, weeping as they went, and the wave of
the sea was parted about them. And it came to pass,
when they were come unto the fertile land of Troy, that
they moved, one after another, up the strand, where had
been beached, in dense array, the ships of the Murmidons
around swift Achilles. And behold, as he uttered deep
groans, his august mother stood beside him; and with
a shrill cry she embraced her noble son, and, amid her
lamentation, spake these winged words :-
'My child, why weepest thou? what sorrow hath
come into thy heart? Speak; hide it not. Surely all
things have been accomplished by Zeus, as aforetime
thou didst pray, with lifted hands, that the sons of the
Achaians should be hemmed in at the ships' sterns, sorely
needing thee, and should suffer dolorous woes.'
78.] Deeply groaning, swift-footed Achilles made
answer:-
'O my mother, these things hath Zeus indeed accom-
plished: but what profit have I therein? For Patroklos,

94.] Then answered Thetis, with falling tears :-
'Verily, my child, swift will be thy doom, if such thy
purpose: for, Hektor slain, straightway is thine own
fate at hand.'
Then answered swift-footed Achilles, in sore indig-
nation :-

that he had himself sent Patroklos to his doom. This rendering is
certainly attractive.

to his friend, his vehemence, his disregard of consequences, his

helper-and found me not. But now¹, seeing I return
not to my dear country, nor was I a light of salvation to
Patroklos, nor to the residue of my companions slain in
their multitudes by godlike Hektor,-while I sit here
beside the ships, cumbering the ground in vain, though
there be none like me among the bronze-mailed Achaians,
in war, albeit in the folkmote, belike, there are others
better than I,-now let strife perish from among gods

past be past, despite our grief,-and hold our hearts
in duress, as needs we must.

that dear life. And then will I welcome death, when-
soever Zeus and the other deathless gods be minded to
accomplish it. For neither did even the might of

But now let me win some noble renown, and constrain

away the tear from her tender cheeks with both hands,

127.] And Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, answered
him on this wise:-
'Aye, verily, my son; it is of a truth no evil thing to
fend sheer destruction from friends in their strait. But
lo, thy fair harness, gleaming and wrought of bronze, is
in the hands of the Trojans; Hektor of the waving
plume beareth it upon his shoulders, exulting; yet
methinks he will not long glory therein, seeing death is
nigh unto him also. Howbeit do thou enter not yet the
tumult of Ares, or ever thou behold me with thine eyes
come hither; for in the morning, with the rising sun,
shall I return, bearing from the lord Hephaistos fair
armour.'
138.] With such words she turned back from her son,
and thereafter spake unto her sisters of the sea :—
'Make now your way to the sea's broad bosom, to
visit the halls of your father, the old man of the deep³,
and tell him all things; while I go to high Olumpos,

ancient world generally—it is the external order of the world colliding
with the internal order of the individual spirit that moves the wonder
and terror of men. The deeper trial of a struggle with Fate itself had
not yet emerged into full consciousness. Fatalism, indeed, was part
and parcel of Greek thought.

he will give famous armour, bright-shining, unto my
son.'
145.] Thus she spake, and without ado they dived
beneath the sea wave. But Thetis, silver-footed goddess,
went unto Olumpos, to bring famous armour for her
loved son. And her feet bare her to Olumpos; but the
Achaians, with amazing shout, fleeing from before man-
slaying Hektor, came to the ships and to the Hellespont¹.
Yet it was not the well-greaved Achaians that had
drawn the dead Patroklos, henchman of Achilles, out of
range; for yet again had foot and horse, aye, and Hektor,
Priam's son, in strength like unto flame, overtaken him.
Thrice did glorious Hektor seize him from behind by
the feet, eager to drag him away, and shout amain to the
Trojans; and thrice did the two Aiantes, putting forth
impetuous might, force him backward from the corpse.
Hektor the while, unshaken, confident in his strength,
would dash now into the fray, now stand shouting aloud,
yet give way no whit. As shepherds of the pasture
cannot drive a tawny lion, grievously anhungered,
from the carcass of the slain: so could not the Aiantes,
warriors twain, scare Hektor, Priam's son, from the
body. And now would he have snatched it from them,
and won renown unspeakable, had not wind-swift Iris,
sweeping downward from Olumpos, come with tidings
unto Achilles, bidding him arm. And she stood near
him, and spake winged words :-

kind, and help Patroklos, for whose sake the hideous
battle tarrieth¹ before the ships. Behold, they slay one
another, these defending the dead, while the men of
Troy rush forward to draw him to windy Ilion. Above
all other doth glorious Hektor yearn to drag him away;
his heart biddeth him strike the head from the tender
neck and set it upon the palisades. But up! lie here

answer :-
'Nay, Goddess Iris, but which of the gods hath sent
thee to bring me tidings?'
And wind-swift Iris spake unto him on this wise :-

of the Immortals, who haunt snow-capped Olumpos,

peoples (Tylor, Primitive Culture ³, i. 451). The intention of the act
of mutilation is clear; the murderer sought to deprive his victim of
the power to exact vengeance for his wrongs (Lawson, Modern Greek
Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion, p. 435).

187.] Then swift-footed Achilles answered her and
spake :-
'Say, how am I to hie me unto the moil? Behold,
the foemen hold the walls; and my dear mother suffered
me not to arm, or ever I should with mine eyes discern
her returning. For her promise stood that she would
fetch goodly harness from Hephaistos. I know not
another whose famous arms I might don, save the shield
of Aias, son of Telamon. But he himself, I suppose,
engageth among the foremost, battling with the spear for
dead Patroklos.'

'Well we know that thy famous armour is in their
hands; howbeit go as thou art to the moat, and manifest
thyself to the Trojans, if peradventure, cowering before
thee, they may surcease from war, while the Achaians'
chivalry have respite from their weariness. Verily
even a brief respite from war counteth for much '.'
202.] So saying, swift-footed Iris passed away. Then
rose Achilles, loved of Zeus; and Athena flung her
tasselled aegis about his mighty shoulders, and round
his head the queenly goddess wreathed a golden cloud,
and from the hero's self kindled an all-shining flame. As
when smoke from a city goeth heavenward, far off from
out an island beleaguered with foes; all day long the
defenders contend in grisly war from their own city,

The magnificent passage which follows (202-231) has been
translated by Tennyson. The careful student should compare the
English poet's rendering with the original; despite its admirable
workmanship the Tennysonian version is lacking in Homeric fire;
the rapidity and radiance of the Greek have vanished. Where
Tennyson failed, another may be pardoned if his attempt is un-
successful. In sober truth, Homer cannot be translated.

but, at sundown, signal-fires flame forth, blaze after
blaze, and the glare shooteth aloft, for neighbour-folk to
descry, if haply these may sail out to their salvation: even
so from the head of Achilles went up the splendour to
heaven¹. From wall to trench he stept; then stood, yet
mingled not with the Achaians; for he reverenced his
mother's wise behest. There stood he, and shouted
aloud; and, far away, Pallas Athena uttered a cry; and
he roused among the Trojans tumult unspeakable.
Loud as the blast of a trumpet, when it shrilleth forth,
blown by slaughterous foes beleaguering a city: so
loudly rang the voice of Achilles, son of Aiakos. But
when they heard that brazen cry, the minds of all
were dismayed; and the fair-maned horses turned the
chariots backward, for their hearts foreboded sorrow.
And the charioteers were troubled when they beheld the
dread unweariable fire blazing above the head of Peleus'
high-hearted son; and the goddess, bright-eyed Athena,
did kindle it. Thrice did godlike Achilles utter a mighty
shout above the trench; thrice were the Trojans and
their famous allies dumfoundered. And then and there
twelve of the noblest perished beside their own chariots
and upon their own spears ³.
1 The comparison is between the flame flashing out of the golden
cloud above the head of Achilles, and the beacon-fire which, in the
gloaming, flares out beneath its column of smoke. The circumstances
of the island siege serve as framework for the image of the beacon
(Jebb, Introd. to Homer, p. 27).
2 Homer mentions the trumpet only in similes. But (as Jebb points
out, n. on Soph. Ajax 17) the Greeks must have had it at least as early
as the Dorian conquest, to judge from the legends heard by Pausanias
at Argos, where there was a shrine of ’A¤ŋvâ ZáλTIY§.

231.] But the Achaians gladly drew Patroklos out of
range and laid him upon a bier; and his friends stood
round weeping. And among them followed swift-footed
Achilles, shedding hot tears when he beheld his faithful
friend lying upon a bier pierced through with the sharp
bronze. Him indeed had he sent to the war with
chariot and horses; but never came he home again,
safe, for Achilles to welcome.
Then did large-eyed Hera, august goddess, send forth
the tireless sun to hie him to Ocean's streams, sore
against his will¹. And the sun sank, and the goodly
Achaians had rest from harsh battle, and levelling war.
243.] And it came to pass that, on the other side, the
Trojans drew back from the harsh conflict, and loosed
the swift steeds from beneath the chariot-yokes, and
assembled themselves together before they bethought
them of the evening meal. And all stood by while the
assembly lasted, nor did a man dare sit; for fear was
come upon all because Achilles had issued forth, after
long ceasing from grievous warfare.²
Then did wise Pouludamas, son of Panthöos, begin
1 Because it was before the appointed time. Hera was anxious to
shorten a day so lucky for her enemies, the Trojans.
2 From this moment the action of the Iliad advances rapidly.
Achilles takes his proper place, and occupies the whole stage. The
body of Patroklos is brought home to him; he mourns over it, and
promises to bury it, when he shall have slain Hektor and slaughtered
twelve sons of the Trojans on the pyre. Then he reconciles himself
with Agamemnon and formally renounces his anger. Lastly, when
he has put on the divine armour made for him by Hephaistos,
he ascends his car, and hastens into the fight. But again at this
point, when Achilles is at the very pitch and summit of his glory, the
voice of Fate is heard. It is with the promise of the tomb that he
enters the battle' (Symonds. The Greek Poets³, i. 90).

the harangue; for he alone could see before and after'.
Hektor was his friend; in the selfsame night were they
born; but whereas the former excelled in speech, the
latter did far surpass in prowess. With good under-
standing spake Pouludamas in the midst :-
2
254.] 'Consider well, my friends; for my sentence is
that we return this hour to the city, nor wait divine
morn in the plain anigh the ships; we be far from
the wall. While yonder man was wroth with godlike
Agamemnon, the Achaians were easier to fight against ;
for I, at least, rejoiced to pass the night by their swift
curved ships, hoping to take them. But now fear I
terribly swift-footed Achilles; such his overweening
pride, he will not stay in the plain, where Trojans and
Achaians share between them the fury of Ares'; nay,
he will strike for our city and our wives.
But hearken to me: let us betake ourselves to the
city; for it will be on this wise. Now hath sweet night
stayed swift-footed Achilles; but if, to-morrow, when he
cometh forth in his panoply, he find us here, there be
some of us that will know what manner of man he is;
for whosoever escapeth will be fain to reach sacred Ilion,
and many a Trojan will the dogs and vultures devour:
1 Pouludamas, the wise, is everywhere a set-off to Hektor the rash,
just as Patroklos the mild to Achilles the fierce, Aias the man-of-arms
to Odusseus the man of wiles (Paley). Pouludamas 'wisdom' con-
sisted in taking 'wide views' (öpa «póσσw naì ỏwiσow). Cf. Shake-
speare, Hamlet, iv. 4. 36:—

oh, far be that omen from me! But if, though sore
vexed, ye hearken to my words, we shall all night long
husband our strength in camp¹, and the city will be
guarded by its walls, and lofty gates, and the beams.
fastened thereon, long, smooth, and closely barred.
At early dawn, girt with our harness, will we man the
walls. And then the worse for him, if he be minded
to quit the ships, and battle against us to win the wall!
Back will he go to the ships, after he hath sated his
arched-necked steeds with manifold rushings to and fro,
wandering idly beneath the city. For all his courage,
never will he enter therein, nor will he sack it; sooner
will the quick-paced dogs devour him.'
284.] Then did Hektor of the glancing helm make
answer, eyeing him askance :—
'Pouludamas, now are the words thou speakest hate-
ful to me, for thou biddest us go back and be hemmed
within the city. Have ye not long enough already
been hemmed within the walls? For whereas of old
all men were wont to speak of Priam's city as rich in gold,
rich in bronze; now at length are the goodly treasures
departed from our homes, and many possessions be gone
to Phrugie and pleasant Meïoniê, sold, because mighty
Zeus is wroth with us. But now that the son of
crooked-counselling Kronos hath vouchsafed to me to
win glory at the ships, and to drive the Achaians into

bars, to give extra security.

for one thing, and the high ransom required for redemption of
captives, must have been severely felt during the nine years of
the siege.

the sea, no longer declare these thy thoughts among the
folk, thou fool! For not one Trojan will give ear;
I will not suffer it. Rather go ye forth, and let us obey
my word.
Take now victual throughout the host,
ranked in battle array; and bethink you of your
watches, and bide awake, each one. And if any of the
Trojans is weary overmuch by reason of his posses-
sions, let him gather them together and give them to be
for a support of the people; better that some of these
should have enjoyment thereof, than the Achaians'.
At early dawn, girt with our harness, let us rouse keen
war by the hollow ships. And if godlike Achilles be,
in very truth, risen from among the ships, the worse
for him, if he will have it so. Of a certainty I shall
not fly from loud-resounding battle, but stand to
face him, whether he bear the palm of victory,-or
haply I myself. The god of battles ³ hath no respect of
persons; and ofttimes is the slayer slain.'

roared applause. Infatuate! for Pallas Athena had
bereft them of their wits. To Hektor's evil counsel
they yielded assent, but no man applauded Poulu-
1 The taunt is aimed at Pouludamas, who is accused of timidity,
because (it is implied) he desires to go back and look after his
wealth. Amid the general impoverishment, Pouludamas (so Hektor
hints) has been hoarding his goods.

The aλylov of the next line sarcastically repeats Pouludamas' words

damas, whose device was prudent. Then took they their
supper throughout the host; but all night long the
Achaians¹ made lamentations, wailing for Patroklos.
And Achilles led the bitter dirge, laying his slaughter-
ous hands upon his comrade's bosom, groaning full
oft, like some strong-bearded lioness whose cubs a hunter
hath snatched away from a dense covert; she, too late
arriving, maketh lament, thridding many a dell, follow-
ing the huntsman's tracks, seeking if anywhere she might
find him; for wrath most poignant moveth her²: even
so did Achilles, moaning deeply, bespeak his Murmi-
dons:-
324.] 'Woe is me! in sooth an idle word I launched
on that day, when I strove to comfort the hero Menoitios
in his house; I told him that I would bring back his
famous son to Opoeis, after that he had sacked Ilion
and won a share of the booty. But Zeus bringeth not
every thought of man to pass; for it is fated that here,
in Troy, we both redden the same earth with blood,
for neither shall my father Peleus, the aged knight,
welcome me, returning home; no, nor my mother
Thetis; but here shall earth hold me fast. And now,
Patroklos, since at any rate I shall go underground
after thee, I will not bury thee until I bring hither the
armour and the head of Hektor, murderer of thee, the
noble-hearted. Twelve fair sons of Troy shall I slaughter
before thy pyre, in fury for thy undoing. Meanwhile
I shall suffer thee to lie unburied by the beaked ships;

and round thee Trojan women and deep-bosomed
daughters of Dardanos shall weep, night and day
letting fall their tears', even they whom our own hands
had won by toil and the long spear, after that we had
sacked the rich cities of mortal men.'
343.] And when he had so said, godlike Achilles
bade his comrades set over the fire a huge vessel, that
with all dispatch they might wash away the gore from
Patroklos. And they stood a vessel for ablutions upon
the blazing fire, and poured water therein, and took
faggots and kindled them beneath; and the fire em-
braced the belly of the vessel, and the water was
heated. But when the water was aboil in the dazzling
bronze, then they washed the body and anointed it
richly with oil, and filled the wounds with an unguent
nine years old. And they laid it upon a bier and wrapt
it in a linen shroud from head to foot, and covered it
above with a white pall.
354] All night long round swift-footed Achilles did
the Murmidons make lamentation over Patroklos; but
Zeus spake unto Hera, his sister and wife :-

'So thou hast had thy way, after all¹, queen Hera of
the calm eyes. Thou hast aroused swift-footed Achilles.
Surely from thine own self must the long-haired
Achaians be sprung 2.'
Then Hera, calm-eyed queen, made reply:-
'Most dread son of Kronos, what word is this thou
hast spoken? Verily a mere man, who is mortal
and knoweth not such devices as we, will accomplish
his purpose for another; how then should I, who deem
myself the queen of heaven, alike by generation and
because I am called the spouse of thee, that art king
over all the Immortals, accomplish not sorrow for the
Trojans in my fierce anger?'
368.] Thus they communed one with the other.
But silver-footed Thetis came to the house of Hephais-
tos, imperishable, adorned with stars, wonderful in the
eyes of the Immortals, wrought of bronze, whom the
crook-footed god had fashioned with his own hands.
Him she found sweating, busy with the bellows, in
hot haste; for he was making twenty tripods to stand
about the wall of heaven's well-grounded palace; and
beneath, at the base of each, fixed he golden wheels*,

were unaccustomed. Savages do the like to this day. (Cf. Pope,

behold. Now they were all but finished, save for the
carven handles; and these he was even now fashioning,
and forging the rivets. And while he toiled thereat
with craftsman's cunning, behold the goddess, silver-
footed Thetis, drew nigh. Then Charis¹, wife of
renowned Hephaistos that halted on both knees, stept
forth when she descried her, and, grasping her hand,
hailed her and spake :-
'Why comest thou to our house, Thetis of the trailing
robe, goddess honoured and beloved? Hitherto thou
wert no constant guest. But follow me in, that I may
set victual before thee.'
388.] So spake the beauteous goddess, and brought
her in. Then she sat her upon a silver-studded throne,
fair to look upon, wrought with cunning work; and
beneath was a stool for her feet. And she summoned
Hephaistos, the famed craftsman, and thus spake she :—
'Hephaistos, come hither; Thetis hath need of thee.'
And Hephaistos the renowned, that halteth on both
knees, answered:-.
'In very truth within my house is a dread and revered
goddess, she that saved me when anguish seized me that
day I fell afar by the will of my shameless mother, who
was fain to hide me because I was lame'. Then had

is depicted as born lame; in the first book (590 sqq.) Zeus is said to

caught me to their bosoms¹. In their company I wrought,
for nine years, many a cunning work,-brooches, and
twisted amulets, earrings, and chains, within a hollow
grot; and round about the Ocean-stream flowed limitless,
roaring with foam; and none, whether god or mortal
man, knew thereof; but Thetis and Eurunomê, my
deliverers, knew. And now is she come unto our house;
wherefore I must needs pay fair-tressed Thetis guerdon
for my life saved. But set now before her fair enter-

halting, from the anvil-stock; and beneath him his
shrunken legs moved nimbly. He thrust the bellows
from the fire, and gathered all the gear wherewith he
wrought into a silver chest; with a sponge he wiped his
face and both hands, his sturdy neck and shaggy bosom ;
then donned a tunic, and took a thick cudgel, and stepped
without, halting as he went; and golden handmaids",
made like to living maidens, moved swiftly beneath to
do their lord's bidding. Understanding is theirs, and
speech and might; and from the immortal gods they
have skill in craft. These handmaids bestirred them-
selves, supporting their lord; and he, moving painfully,

'Ah, Hephaistos, is there any one of all the goddesses
in Olumpos, that hath endured such bitter sorrows as
Zeus, son of Kronos, hath appointed unto me above all
others? Me alone of all the sea-nymphs he wedded to
a mortal man, to Peleus son of Aiakos, and I suffered a

lieth in his halls, broken with pitiful old age; but on

granted that a son should be born to me, and should
grow up, prince of heroes. And behold, he hath sprung
up as a tender plant; I nurtured him like a tree upon a
fruitful hill; I sent him forth with the beaked galleys
against Ilion to do battle with the Trojans; but him I

Achaians chose out as a guerdon for him, her hath prince
Agamemnon taken from his hands unto himself. Through
grief for her he was pining¹ in heart; and the Trojans
hemmed in the Achaians at their ships, nor suffered them
to issue forth. Then did the Argive elders make suppli-
cation unto him, making mention of many a glorious
gift. My son himself consented not to fend them from
bane, but he arrayed Patroklos in armour all his own,
and sent him battleward, and made much people to follow
him. All day long fought they by the Skaian gates; and
now this very day they had sacked the town, had not
Apollo slain among the foremost Menoitios' brave son,-
seeing he had wrought much evil,—and given glory unto
Hektor. Wherefore, kneeling before thee, I make
entreaty if peradventure thou wilt give my swift-doomed
son shield, and helmet, and goodly greaves fitted with
clasps, and breastplate; for that which once was his hath
been lost by his trusty friend, slain by Trojan hands.

nigh, as he shall have fair armour such as all men here-

quest of the bellows, which he turned fireward, and
bade them work³. Twenty bellows in all blew upon the

crucibles, sending forth a fiery blast of diverse powers,
now to aid him when he worked amain, now to
cease when he ceased, according as Hephaistos would,
and the work drew to its ending. Into the fire would
he cast unyielding bronze, and tin, and precious iron,
and silver. Then he set on the block a huge anvil, and
seized in one hand a lusty hammer, and with the other
seized the tongs.
478.] First he fashioned a shield', huge and strong,
with chasing everyway?, and round about made a bright
rim, threefold³, sparkling; and thereto fixed a silver
baldric. Of five layers of hide was the body of the
shield fashioned; and on it he wrought many a fair
device with craftsman's cunning.
483.] He wrought thereon earth, and heaven, and the
sea, the unwearying sun and the moon at full; the stars
also that circle the heaven as with a crown; the Pleiades,
and the Hyads, and the might of Orion, and the Bear-
which men also call the Wain by surname—which

490.] He made also thereon cities of mortal men,
beautiful to look upon. In the one were wedding-
scenes and marriage feasts, and brides fetched from
bridal-chambers through the city to the accompaniment
of blazing torches; loud rose the wedding hymn, and
dancing boys moved featly, and in their midst pipe
and flute kept up the joyous strain; and women, standing
each before her door, gazed wonderingly. There were
people gathered together in the market-place; and
a quarrel had arisen, two men quarrelling over the
blood-price of a murdered man'. The one offered to
pay all the due, displaying it to the assembled folk;
while the other refused to take aught. And both were
eager to make an end before a daysman. And the
common people, taking sides, shouted encouragement
now to the one, now to the other. But the heralds kept
them back. There sat the elders upon polished stones
in a sacred ring, holding in their hands the wands of
loud-voiced heralds. Anon they rose up therewith,
noting that just as the Greek philosophers found their philosophy in
Homer, so early Christian exegetes found in him Christian theology.
Thus, when Hephaistos represents on the shield 'earth, heaven, and
sea, unwearying sun and full moon,' the thought implied is the divine
order of creation which Homer learned in Egypt (so they fable), from
the books of Moses.
1 In primitive communities the shedding of blood could be expiated
only by shedding of blood. But, as civilization advanced, the blood-
feud gave way to the 'fine' (though it may be noted that no fine or
blood-wit could be accepted for slaughter within the kin). The third
stage came when the community as a whole decided the question, in
due course of law before constituted courts. The Homeric Greeks
are in the second stage, as this passage shows. Cf. S. A. Cook, Laws
of Moses and Code of Hammurabi, pp. 255 sqq.; Jevons, Introd. to

harness. Twofold their counsel-whether to sack the
city or make division of all things therein, even of all
the possessions contained within that goodly township.
But the townsmen would in no wise hearken thereto,
but were arming in secret for ambush. Their loving
wives and their little children were guarding the wall
whereon they stood, and with them were men stricken
in age; but the others sallied forth, captained by Ares
and Pallas Athena, all-golden both; and in gold raiment
were they clad, fair and mighty with their harness, like
very gods, standing out' conspicuous; but the hosts at
their feet were of slighter stature. Now when they

And two scouts were set apart from the main host,
waiting till they should behold the sheep and the horned

of the wile. But the ambushed hosts were quick to see,
and ran upon them, and swiftly did they cut off the
herds of kine and the choice flocks of white sheep, and
slew them that tended them. When then the besiegers,
sitting before the gates¹, were ware of a loud tumult

when they had made the turn and touched the limit of
the field, there came forth a man who gave into their
hands a cup of honey-sweet wine; and then, behold,
they went back adown the furrows', eager to reach
the limit of the deep fallow-land; and the land was
darkened behind 2, and seemed like soil that had been
upturned, albeit fashioned in gold; and the workman-
ship thereof was wondrous exceedingly.

and in it were reapers reaping with sharp sickles in
their hands. And here armfuls of corn were falling to
earth, one after another, and here were binders binding
them in sheaves. And three binders stood hard by
them that reaped; and, behind, were lads gathering the
sheaves; and they bare them in their arms, handing
them unceasingly to the binders. And silently, in their
midst, upon the furrow stood a king, sceptre in hand,
with joy in his heart. And apart, underneath an oak,
were heralds preparing a feast, busy over a bullock they
had sacrificed; and women were sprinkling white
barley in plenty, as a meal for the reapers.

effect had been managed, and he here describes it. Plin. Nat. Hist.

black bunches, and from end to end the vineyard stood
up with silver poles'. And round it he drew a trench
of dark enamel, and fenced it with a fence of tin²; and
one sole pathway led to the vineyard, whereby the
reapers passed when they gathered in the vintage.
And lads and maidens, in youthful glee, carried in
woven baskets the honeyed fruit. And in the midst of

and thereto he sang sweetly the song of Linos³ with
clear-ringing voice; while they all, beating the ground
in time, with chaunt and loud acclaim followed on
nimble feet.

horned cattle; the cows were wrought of gold and tin,
and with lowing they wended homeward from the byre
beside a sounding river, fast by a swaying reed-bed.
Four herdsmen, all golden, accompanied them, followed
by nine swift-footed dogs. And two fierce lions, leaping
amid the foremost cows, laid hold of a bellowing bull;
he, loudly roaring, was carried away; while dogs and
lusty hinds followed close on the trail. Next the two

the inventor of the dirge bearing what was fancied to be his name.

floor, like unto that which erst, in broad Knossos, Dai-
dalos had made for fair-haired Ariadne. Thereon young
men and comely damsels were dancing, that clasped
each other by the wrist. The damsels were arrayed in

primitive 'theatre,' where the people would gather to witness sports
and shows, and dancing (the dance possessing some religious signi-

river Okeanos2, along the utmost edge of the stoutly
fashioned shield.
And when Hephaistos had made the shield, strong
and firm, he fashioned a breastplate brighter than
radiance of fire, and a heavy helm, close-fitting to the
temples, fair, richly dight; and upon it he set a golden
crest; greaves, too, he wrought of supple tin.
And it was so, when far-famed Hephaistos, that halteth
on both knees, had finished making all the armour, that
he took it up and set it before the mother of
Achilles. She, hawk-like, sprang from snowy Olumpos,

'THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES is by far the most important
work conceived by Homer. In form and general construction
it differs in no respect from real objects, and even the decora-
tion must be in some measure a reflection of what the poet
had actually seen; but the elaborate composition and the
extraordinary number of figures find no real analogy in
contemporary art, and we are almost prepared for the mythi-
cal element by the circumstances of its supernatural produc-

consisted of a large central space representing the Universe,
surrounded by four narrow concentric bands, of which the
two inner ones were divided into six distinct subjects, while
the two outer depicted respectively a continuous choric dance
and the encircling Ocean. The inner scenes were all taken
from daily life. This arrangement is found on metal bowls
of Phoenician workmanship from Cyprus and Italy, which,
though not older than the sixth century, reflect the style of
an earlier age. It would appear that the figures were not in
relief, but were inlaid in different metals, as variations of
colour are implied. The subjects all find their parallels on
the Phoenician bowls; but we may well believe that the con-
ceptions of the poet's imagination embodied the Greek spirit.'
Thus writes Mr. H. B. Walters in his admirable work The
Art of the Greeks. Now let us hear Walter Pater, in his
suggestive pages on the Heroic Age of Greek Art (Greek
Studies, pp. 201, 204):-
·-
'The Shield of Achilles is part of the suit of armour which
Hephaistos makes for him at the request of Thetis; and it
is wrought of variously coloured metals, woven into a great
circular composition in relief [?], representing the world and
the life in it . . . The forging of the shield is no mere incon-
gruous episode in Homer, but the consummation of what is
always characteristic of him,-a constant preoccupation,
namely, with every form of lovely craftsmanship, resting on
all things, as he says, like the shining of the sun... What is
peculiar in these Homeric descriptions, what distinguishes
them from others at first sight familiar, is a sort of internal
evidence they present of a certain degree of reality, signs in
them of an imagination stirred by surprise at the spectacle
of real works of art... Homer's artistic descriptions, though
enlarged by fancy, are not wholly imaginary; and the
extant remains of monuments of the earliest historical age are
like lingering relics of that dream in a tamer but real world.'¹
¹ Murray, in his History of Greek Sculpture (chap. iii), has attempted
a reconstruction of the Shield from various ancient sources. Cf. Jebb,
Introd. to Homer, pp. 67-70.

THE ILIAD OF HOMER
The description of the Shield has given rise to a whole
literature of its own, and it is extremely difficult (if not
impossible) to be sure as to the exact arrangement of the
various pictures, or the shape and material of the shield
itself. As Platt most justly says: "The difficulty arises from
the general rule that poetry (and prose, too) describes things
in motion, painting or sculpture represents things at rest.
In other words poetry shows things in time, painting in
space. Now Homer was a poet, and he knew very well
that his business was to describe events as happening in
time and in motion; so he leaves the artist to represent
things in the artist's proper way, but for himself he tells the
story of them in the poet's proper way.'
Apparently the Shield was made of five superimposed
layers of hide, with a sixth layer of bronze on the outside.
This was the field, and with it alone the poet's description is
concerned. The pictures are made by inlaying four other
metals on the bronze. Whether the shape of the shield was
circular, or in the figure of 8, is uncertain. As regards the
pictures shown: the outer edge represented the Ocean stream,
and the centre was occupied by the heavenly bodies and the
earth. Ten other subjects are plainly distinguishable, thus:-
(1) Marriage festival: 490-496.
(2) The murder scene: 497-508.
(3) The siege: 509-512.
(4) The sortie from the beleaguered town: 513-540.
(5) Ploughing: 541-549.
(6) Reaping: 550-560.
Field scenes,

summer, autumn.
(8) Cattle attacked by lions: 573-586.
(9) Sheep-folds: 587-589.
(10) The dance: 590-606.
In the magnificent vision of Adam in the eleventh book of
Paradise Lost, Milton plainly shows his admiration for the
description of the Shield of Achilles by borrowing or adapt-
ing many scenes and images from it. The student should
carefully study the whole passage (11. 638-673).

THE RENOUNCING OF THE WRATH.
Thetis brings to Achilles the new armour wrought by Hephaistos.
She bids him assemble the host, and renounce his anger against
Agamemnon. Thereupon the two chieftains are duly reconciled
before the whole Greek assembly. Achilles is eager to take the field
forthwith; but, by the advice of Odusseus, he agrees to refrain till
the troops have satisfied their hunger. Agamemnon's promised gifts
are then brought to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments the
dead Patroklos. Achilles refuses meat and drink, sorrowing for his
friend;
but Athena, by command of Zeus, strengthens him with
heavenly food. He now arms for battle, and sallies forth with the
Greek warriors. The horses are yoked to his chariot, when the horse
Xanthos, speaking with human voice, foretells the doom of Achilles.
Notwithstanding which, the hero rushes furiously to the combat.
SCENE: The Sea-shore.
Morn, with her saffron robe, was rising from the
streams of Okeanos, bringing light to mortals and
immortals; and Thetis came to the ships, bearing the
gifts of Hephaistos'. She found her dear son clasping
Patroklos, and weeping bitterly; and round him stood
many of his henchmen making lamentation. And she
stood in the midst of them, hard by his side, and held
his hand, and spake and hailed him :—
'My son, grieved though we be, let us suffer yonder
man to lie here, since he was laid low once for all by
divine will; and do thou accept from Hephaistos armour,

resplendent, of excellent renown, such as never yet man
wore upon his shoulders.'
12.] With such words the goddess set the glorious
harness before Achilles; and all the spangled armour
rang again. And a tremor seized upon all the
Murmidons, nor did any dare to gaze upon it, but they
turned and fled. But when Achilles beheld, his anger
was kindled yet more, and his eyes flashed balefully
beneath his lids, as it were with a flame of fire; and he
rejoiced as he took in his hands the noble gifts of the
god. And when he had feasted his soul with gazing on
the spangled armour, straightway he spake unto his
mother winged words :-
'My mother, the god hath fashioned harness such as
divine workmanship should be, such as no mortal man
might accomplish. Now verily will I arm; but very
greatly do I fear lest, meanwhile, flies make their way
into the doughty son of Menoitios through wounds
where the bronze hath struck, and gender worms, and
mar the corpse-lo, the life is slain out of him-and all
the flesh rot.'
"
28.] Then did silver-footed Thetis make answer :—
My son, let not these things vex thy heart. Behold,
I will essay to keep from him those fierce tribes, the
flies, which devour warriors slain in war; for should
he lie there a full year, ever will his flesh be firm,—or
even fairer than now. But do thou summon Achaia's
heroes to council, and, renouncing thy wrath against

Agamemnon, shepherd of the folk, arm thee straightway
for battle, and put on strength.'
37.] So spake she, and put into his heart might and
confidence, while into the nostrils of Patroklos she
dropped ambrosia and ruddy nectar', that so his flesh
might be preserved.
Then strode god-like Achilles by the sea-shore, shout-
ing terribly, and roused the Achaian heroes. And they
who aforetime abode within the circle of the ships,
the pilots, and the helmsmen, and the stewards who
served forth victual, thereupon did come now to the
assembly, because that Achilles had appeared, who had
longwhile surceased from grievous warfare. And behold,
there came up limping two henchmen of Ares, to wit,
the son of Tudeus, that staunch warrior, and god-like
Odusseus, leaning upon their spears; for painful were
their wounds; and they went and sate them down in the
forefront of the assembly. Next after them came Aga-
memnon, king of men, wounded also; for him had
Koön, son of Antenor, wounded with bronze javelin in
the grim counter. And when all the Achaians were
now gathered together, among them rose swift-footed
Achilles, who spake on this wise :-
56.] 'Son of Atreus, was this indeed the better course
for us twain, for thee and me, that, vexed in spirit,
we strove in soul-consuming strife, for the sake of a girl?
I would that Artemis had slain her at the ships with an
arrow, that day when I sacked Lurnessos and won her

dotus, where he explains the process of embalming among the Egyp-
tians. Nectar and ambrosia were the legendary food of the gods;
but the Homeric ambrosia is also a perfume (cf. the epithet ambrosial,'
used of sleep = 'sweet,' and night='balmy').

as my prize! Then had fewer Achaians bitten the
broad earth, beneath the hands of foemen, by reason of
my fierce anger. To Hektor and the Trojans belongeth
the gain; but methinks the Achaians will long remember
the strife betwixt me and thee. Howbeit, for all our
pain, let us suffer the past to be past, and quell within us
our pride-as needs we must; this hour, of a truth,
I bate my fury, nor shouldst thou be wrath for ever,
relentlessly¹. Go to now, bid to battle the long-haired
Achaians, that I also may go forth and make trial of
these Trojans once more, if haply they be minded to
bivouac beside the ships 2. Yet I trow that many an one
will gladly bend the knee, if he escape from the fury of
battle before my spear.'
74.] He ended; and the well-greaved Achaians re-
joiced, in that high-souled Achilles had forsworn his
anger. Then spake Agamemnon, king of men, unto them,
seated where he was, for he stood not in the midst :-
'Friends, Danaan heroes, henchmen of Ares, it is
meet to hear a man when he standeth up, nor is it seem-
ly to break in upon his words; for to harangue so were
a hard thing even for the skilled. But amid a mighty
1 One may recall the words of Jeremiah iii. 12, 'I will not keep
mine anger for ever.' Cf. Eph. iv. 26, and a striking parallel from
Plutarch, de amore fratrum 488 B: 'we are to imitate the Pytha-
goreans who... if peradventure at any time they were so far carried
away with choler yet before the sun was gone down they would
shake hands, kiss, and embrace one another, be reconciled, and
become good friends again' (Philemon Holland's version: 1603).
...
2 The alternative will be to save themselves by flight.
3 Achilles will tire them out, even if they escape with their lives.
4 This passage is extremely difficult to interpret aright. I have
done the best I could with somewhat intractable material; but the
curious will consult Leaf's notes. I suppose Agamemnon to be
sitting down, as feeling the pain of his recent wound.

a loud-voiced orator breaketh down. I shall open my
mind to the son of Peleus; but do ye, the rest of the
Achaians, give heed, and mark, each one, my words.
Many a time have the Achaians cast that word of thine¹
in my teeth, upbraiding me; yet am not I to blame, but
Zeus and Destiny and the Fury that moveth in darkness,
who put grim infatuation into my heart at the assembly,

the Litai, Prayers of Repentance, who, halting and with downcast
eyes, come to heal the harm (cf. ix. 502). Monro quotes Shelley,
Adonais, xxiv :—
'Out of her secret Paradise she sped
Thro' camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,
And human hearts, which to her aëry tread
Yielding not, wounded the invisible
Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell.'
There are many instances in Homer where, in the final analysis,
the responsibility for sin is laid at the door of Heaven, though there
is one remarkable passage (Odyssey i. 32 sqq.) in which Zeus protests
against this imputation. In Homer, as Adam shrewdly notes (Reli-
gious Teachers of Greece, p. 39), there is no Devil to bear the blame.

Glazebrook in his Warburton Lectures, The End of the Law, chap. vii.

she hath infatuated Zeus himself, whom men deem
chiefest of gods and men. Nay, even him Hera, woman
like, cheated with her wiles, on the day when Alkmene
was to bring the might of Herakles to birth in wall-
crowned Thebes. Exultingly he spake unto all the
gods:-
"Hear me, gods and goddesses all, that I may tell all
that is in my heart. To-day shall Eileithuia, that suc-
coureth women in travail, bring to light a man-child,
who shall rule over all neighbouring peoples', -a hero
sprung from them that are of my lineage."
106.] Then, with cunning guile, queen Hera spake
unto him on this wise:-
-
"False wilt thou prove, nor hereafter wilt thou crown
thy words with fulfilment. Come now, Olympian King,
swear a mighty oath that he shall in very truth be lord
of all neighbouring peoples, who shall this day be born
of woman,—a hero sprung from them that are of thy
lineage."
Thus she spake; and Zeus in no wise marked her
fraud, but he sware a mighty oath, and therein was
grievously beguiled.
Then Hera sped away and left the peak of Olumpos,
and came speedily to Achaian Argos, where dwelt, she
knew, the comely wife of Sthenelos, son of Perseus.
Great was she with child, and the seventh month was
afoot; but Hera brought the babe to light, untimely,
and stayed Alkmene from bearing, and checked her
pains. Then hasted she with the news to Zeus, son of
Kronos, and spake :-
1 T. L. Agar reads this line thus :-
ἐκφανέει πάντεσσι περικτιόνεσσιν ἀνάσσειν.

"Lord of the lightning, Father Zeus, verily I will tell
thee a thing. This day there is born a goodly man-
child, who will rule over the Argives, even Eurustheus
son of Sthenelos, Perseus's son, sprung from thee; no
shame for him to rule over the Argives."
125.] Thus she spake; but, as for Zeus, sharp sorrow
smote him to the heart's depth. Without ado he plucked
Atê by her smooth-tressed head, in the fury of his heart,
and swore a great oath that never more should she, who
deludeth all men, come unto Olumpos and the starry
heaven. With such words he seized her, whirled her
in his hand, and cast her forth from the starry heaven;
and anon she came to the world of men. Ever did he
groan because of her, whensoever he beheld his dear
son plying a shameful task at the bidding of Eurustheus'.

sterns, could not forget the infatuation wherewith I was

eyes behold them, and do thou be comforted in thine

Argives, swear that he hath never slept with Briseis,
nor lain with her; and let thy soul be cheered. And
thereafter let him rejoice these at the tent with rich
feasting, that thou mayst have no lack of justice. And
thou, son of Atreus, in after-time shalt be more just with
another; for verily it is no shame for a king to make
atonement to another, when he hath provoked the wrong.'

reply:-
'Son of Laërtes, well pleased am I to have heard thy
words; for all that thou hast said is well and duly
spoken. Gladly will I make an oath; thereto my heart
prompteth me; nor will I forswear it before the face of
heaven. But let Achilles bide here awhile, notwithstand-
ing his zeal for war; and likewise do ye bide all
together, till the gifts be come from the tent, and we
twain have ratified a trusty bond. Upon thine own self,
Odusseus, I lay this behest: choose thee out the flower
of Panachaian chivalry, to fetch from my ship the gifts
we promised to Achilles yesternight, and withal to bring
the women. Also let Talthubios make haste throughout
the wide host of Achaia, and prepare a boar, for sacrifice
unto Zeus and Helios '.'

far, stronger art thou than I, and much doughtier with
the spear: but it may be I excel thee not a little in
wisdom, for I am older and know more¹. Wherefore

gold, ana led the way, followed by the rest of Achaia's
chivalry laden with gifts. These they set in the
assembly's midst, and Agamemnon rose up; while
Talthubios, whose voice was like unto that of a god, stood
beside the shepherd of the folk, holding a boar. Then
the son of Atreus drew with his hands a knife, which
ever hung close to his sword's huge scabbard, and from
the victim shore a tuft of bristles', and prayed, lifting
his hands to Zeus; and all the Argives sat by in fitting
silence, listening to the king.
257.] Then, with eyes gazing into heaven, after this
manner prayed he :—
'Be Zeus my witness this day, he that is supreme
among all gods, and Earth and Sun and the Erinues ³
who dwell in the underworld and punish men that swear
falsely, that never did I lay hand on the maid Briseis,
desiring to embrace her, nor for aught else'; nay, but
she hath stayed undeflowered in my tents. If in this
I am forsworn, then may the gods send upon me all
the plagues full many, wherewith they afflict him that,
by a false oath, hath transgressed against them.'

265.] With such words he cut the boar's throat with
pitiless bronze. Then Talthubios whirled and flung the
victim into the depth of the hoary sea, to be meat for
fishes; and Achilles rose up, and spake to the war-loving
Argives :-

'Father Zeus, verily great are the delusions thou
sendest upon mankind'. Never would the son of Atreus
have stirred the soul within me so utterly, nor would he,
in the perverseness of his heart, have stolen the maid.
from me in my despite, had not Zeus been minded that
destruction should befall many Achaians. But now get
you gone to supper, that we may the sooner join battle.'
276.] He ended speaking, and brake up the assembly
in hot haste. So the people scattered, each man to his
own ship. But the high-hearted Murmidons busied
themselves with the gifts, and took their way, bearing
them to the ship of godlike Achilles; and they laid them
in the tent, and placed the women there also, and noble
henchmen drave the steeds to the herd.
282.] Now it came to pass when Briseis, fair as
golden Aphrodite, beheld Patroklos stricken with the
sharp bronze, that she fell upon the dead man and wept
bitterly, and with her fingers tare her bosom, and soft
skin, and beauteous face 2. And thus she spake weeping,
a woman lovely as the goddesses :-
'O Patroklos, loved beyond all by me, sad-hearted,

pierced with the sharp bronze; and my three brothers,
children of one mother, my loved ones, who all met
disastrous day¹. Yet wouldst thou not let me so much
as weep, when swift Achilles had slain my husband, and
sacked the city of goodly Munes, but declaredst that he
would make me the wedded wife of godlike Achilles, who
should take me in ships to Phthiê, and there celebrate
a marriage-feast among his Murmidons. Wherefore
unceasingly I mourn thee dead, for thou wert ever
gentle.'
301.] So she spake, with tears; and the other women
wept with her; Patroklos was the plea², yet each be-
wailed her own sorrows. But around Achilles the
Achaian elders were gathered, beseeching him to taste
food howbeit he refused, with groans :-
:
'I pray you, if any of my dear comrades will hearken
to me, ask me not to satisfy my hunger with meat and
drink, seeing that dire grief befalleth me. Till sundown
I will abide, and still endure.'
So saying, he sent away the other chieftains, but the
two sons of Atreus remained, and godlike Odusseus,

'Vidi ego consortes pariter generisque necisque
Tres cecidisse; tribus quae mihi mater erat.'
Прópaσi: usually taken as signifying a pretended motive. But
(as was long ago pointed out by Shilleto in his note on Thucyd. i. 23)
Прópaσis need convey no such meaning. Twice in Thucydides it is
used of a real, as opposed to a pretended, motive or cause. In several
other passages it has a neutral sense ('plea' or 'motive,' alleged
truly or falsely). But Lawson, in his valuable Modern Greek Folk-lore
and Ancient Greek Religion (pp. 348, 349), takes the word in its conven-
tional interpretation, remarking: 'Patroclus's death finished the excuse
and the occasion for tears, but most of those tears were shed for
nearer sorrows, dearer losses. To-day the manner is the same.'

Nestor, and Idomeneus, and Phoinix, the aged knight,
seeking to comfort him in his bitter anguish; but he
refused to be comforted till he had entered the jaws
of bloody war. Then, as he bethought him of Patroklos,
he fetched a heavy sigh and spake aloud :-
'Ah, dearest friend, ill-fated, many a time and oft it
was thou thyself that didst set before me in my tent
the dainty banquet with eager zeal, whensoever the
Achaians hasted to bring tearful war against the horse-
taming Trojans. But now thou liest, pierced through
and through; and my heart refuseth meat and drink,
from all the store within, for love of thee. No worse
evil could I suffer-no, not even if I should learn of mine
own sire's death, who now somewhere in Phthiê letteth
drop a tender tear, bereft of me, his valiant son.
But I,
among a strange people, war against the Trojans because
of Helen, the abhorred. No worse, even should I learn
of his death, who groweth to manhood in Skuros¹,-if
indeed he still liveth,-mine own dear son, godlike
Neoptolemos. Erstwhile I cherished the hope that I
alone should perish here, in the land of Troy, far from
Argos, the nurse of steeds, and that thou wouldst return
to Phthiê, to fetch him, my son, with thy swift black
ship from Skuros, and show him all my wealth-my
inheritance, my slaves, and my great high-roofed palace.
For now, methinks, Peleus is either wholly dead, or,
1 Neoptolemos was born in Skuros, and remained there under the
care of his grandfather Lukomedes, till he went to Troy. Soon after
the birth of his son, Achilles returned to Phthiê; it was eight years
or more later that he went to the Trojan war, without revisiting the
home where his son was. There is, however, another version of the
tale, according to which Achilles had remained in Skuros till Odusseus
took him to Troy. Neoptolemos was a hero of the later epic (the
'Kupria' and 'Little Iliad').

338.] He spake with tears, and the elders lifted up
their voices with him when they remembered all that he
had left at home. And when he beheld them lamenting,
the Son of Kronos had compassion upon them, and
swiftly uttered winged words to Athena :-
'Daughter, of a truth thou forsakest utterly thy hero.
Carest thou no more for Achilles? Yonder he sitteth
before the high-horned galleys, sorrowing for his loved
friend; the rest are gone to their meal, but he fasteth
and is unfed. Go to, now, drop nectar and ambrosia
into his bosom, lest he be famished.'
349.] With such words he spurred Athena, nowise
loth. Like a long-winged falcon, shrill-voiced, from
heaven she sped through the clear air. Now were the
Achaians arming straightway throughout the host; and
she dropped nectar into the bosom of Achilles, and wel-
come ambrosia, lest joyless hunger should subdue his
strength; then hied her back to the lordly house of her
mighty sire. And in the meantime the Achaians kept
pouring forth from their swift ships.
357.] As when the snow-flakes fly thick and fast out
of heaven, cold beneath the blast of the frosty North
wind so thick, issuing from the ships, streamed flashing
helms, and bossy shields, plated corslets, and ashen
spears¹. And the sheen thereof went up to heaven,

a fine line, perhaps imitated from Homer, in Lucretius ii. 325 'totaque

omnis aere renidenti tellus.' For the expression yéλaσσe cf. Psalm

and all about the whole earth laughed with the flash of
bronze. And underneath there rose a din of armed
heels; and in the midst godlike Achilles donned his
armour. Audibly he gnashed his teeth', and his eyes
blazed as they had been a flame of fire, and anguish in-
tolerable entered his heart; and in fierce wrath against
the Trojans he arrayed him in the heavenly gifts, which
Hephaistos had wrought. First he girded about his
legs the goodly greaves, fastened with silver buckles;
next he put the breastplate upon his breast. Upon his
shoulders he flung a bronzen sword, with silver studded;
then took a shield huge and doughty, from the which
went forth a light as of the moon 2.
373.] As when to mariners out at sea appeareth the
light of a burning fire; high upon the hills it burneth
in some lonely steading; they, the while, reluctant and
severed from their friends, are swept by tempests
over the finny deep: even so from Achilles' beauteous
targe, wrought by craftsman's skill, flashed the gleam to
heaven.

And he took his massy helm and set it upon his head;
bright as a star glittered that horse-plumed helm; and
the hairs thereof, which Hephaistos had planted thick
about the crest, waved all-gold. And godlike Achilles,

socket he drew his father's spear, ponderous, huge, and
stout; this none other of the Achaians could wield, but

from Pelion's top, to be the bane of heroes.

steeds :-

feited of war; nor be it as erewhile it was when ye left
Patroklos dead upon the field.'

glancing-footed steed, unto Achilles; forthright he
bowed his head, and all his mane, streaming downward

from the cushion beside the yoke, fell to earth; and the
goddess, white-armed Hera, gave him the utterance of
a man ¹
'Verily this day shall we bring thee back safe, great
Achilles. But know thou the day of doom is nigh; yet
are not we the cause, but some mighty god and resist-
less fate. Not through sloth nor sluggishness' of ours
did the Trojans take the armour from the shoulders of
Patroklos; nay, but the doughtiest of gods, he whom
fair-haired Leto bare, smote him among the foremost,
and so gave glory to Hektor. We twain might run
apace with the blast of the west-wind, fleetest of all
winds, so men deem; howbeit for thee it is decreed
to perish by the power of god and man‘.'
418.] Thus spake Xanthos, but the Erinues suffered
him no more. And, high in wrath, swift-footed
Achilles made answer :-
'Ah, Xanthos, why prophesiest thou my death?
No need of this from thee! Well I know, even I
myself, that my doom is to perish here, far from sire
and mother. Yet for all this will I not surcease or
ever I have glutted the Trojans with war.'

So he spake, and, with a mighty cry, vanward held
his firm-hoofed steeds¹.
1 The dialogue between Achilles and Xanthos is important.
'Homer is about to show the hero raging in carnage, exulting over
suppliants and slain foes, terrible in his ferocity. It is consistent
with the whole character of Achilles, who is fiery, of indomitable
fury, that he should act thus. Stung as he is by remorse and by the
sorrow for Patroclus, which does not unnerve him, but rather kindles
his whole spirit into flame, we are prepared to see him fierce even to
cruelty. But when we remember that in the midst of the carnage
he is himself moving a dying man, when we remember that he is
sending his slain foes like messengers before his face to Hades, when
we keep the warning words of Thetis and of Xanthus in mind, then
the grim fury of Achilles becomes dignified. The world is in a
manner over for him, and he appears the incarnation of disdainful
anger and revengeful love, the conscious scourge of God and instru-
ment of destiny' (Symonds, The Greek Poets³, vol. i. p. 91).

THE BATTLE OF THE GODS', AND THE ACTS OF Achilles.
Zeus, upon the return of Achilles to the battle, holds an assembly
of the gods, and suffers them to take part in the war. The gods come
down from Olumpos to the plain of Troy-some siding with the
Greeks, some with the Trojans.
Apollo urges Aineias to challenge Achilles, whereupon the gods
retire to watch the issue. Achilles and Aineias meet; and Aineias
is miraculously preserved by Poseidon. Achilles next falls upon the
Trojans, and is on the point of slaying Hektor, who is enraged by
the death of Poludoros, when Apollo conveys him away in a cloud.
Achilles, raging unchecked, pursues the Trojans with great slaughter.
SCENE: In the Field before Troy.
Thus were the Achaians, unsated of battle, arming
themselves by their beaked galleys around thee, son of
Peleus; while, over against them, on ground that rose
from off the plain, stood the Trojans. Then did Zeus bid
Themis 2 summon the gods to council from the summit
of many-folded Olumpos; and she went to and fro
bidding them come unto the house of Zeus. Not one

prologue (1-74) more justly belongs to the next book, in which
Achilles' fight with the River-god is detailed. The second section,

prowess of Aineias. It is not till we reach the third section (11. 381
to end) that the true story of the Iliad is resumed.
2 Themis has two functions in Homer: (1) she convenes and
dissolves assemblies; (2) she presides over the feast.

river was absent, save only Okeanos¹, nor any of the
nymphs of all that haunt sweet glades, or river-springs,
or grassy meads. So they came to the house of cloud-
gathering Zeus, and sate them down in marble 2 colon-
nades wrought by Hephaistos with craftsman's cunning
for father Zeus.
12.] Thus were they gathered together in the house
of Zeus; even the Earth-shaker flouted not the goddess,
but came out of the sea to join them, and sat in the
midst and inquired after the will of Zeus:-
Wherefore, Lord of the levin, hast thou summoned
the gods to council? dost thou purpose aught concerning
the Trojans and Achaians? for behold, the war that
rageth between them toucheth us most nearly³.'
Then spake cloud-gathering Zeus and made reply :-
'Earth-shaker, well knowest thou my purpose, for the
which I have brought you together; verily, the Trojans
in the day of destruction claim my care. But I myself
will abide here in a fold of Olumpos, where I will look
abroad and take my ease; as for the residue of you, get
you gone that ye may help either Trojans or Achaians,
even as ye severally list. For if Achilles unaided * shall
fight against the Trojans, they will not keep back swift-
footed Achilles, no, not even for an hour. Yea, even in
times past they quaked when they beheld him; but now,

when he rageth terribly by reason of his friend, I fear
lest he overleap the wall, defying fate.'
Thus spake the son of Kronos, and stirred up unabating
war. Then hasted the gods to battle, their counsel
divided; Hera and Pallas Athena sought the station of
the ships, and there companied with them Poseidon, that
shaketh the land, and Hermes, bringer of luck¹, renowned
for his quick wit. And there went also with them
Hephaistos, exulting in his strength; lame of foot was he,
but beneath him his shrunken shanks moved nimbly.
To the Trojans sped Ares, with waving plume, and
with him went Phoibos with unshorn locks 2, Artemis the
archer-queen, Leto, and Xanthos³, and laughter-loving
Aphrodite.
41.] Now while the gods held aloof from mortal men,
so long were the Achaians greatly triumphant, in that
Achilles had appeared, who for long had surceased from
the bitter fray. But dire trembling had seized upon the
limbs of the Trojans, each one, for they were afraid
when they beheld the swift-footed son of Peleus shining
in his armour, terrible as Ares, the plague of men.
when the Olympians were come unto the press of men,
up rose Strife, the mighty one that stirreth nations; and
Athena uttered a shout; standing now beside the deep
trench, without the wall, now crying aloud along the far-

Simoïs, upon the slope of Kallikolônê.
53] Thus did the blessed gods, urging on both Greeks
and Trojans, meet in conflict, and caused grievous strife
to break out among men. Then did the Sire of men and
gods thunder terribly from on high; and, underneath,
Poseidon shook the boundless earth and the lofty
summits of the hills; and all the feet of many-fountained
Ida, and its crests, did quake, and the city of Troy and
the Achaian ships. And far beneath Aïdoneus, lord of
the realms below ¹, trembled, and in fear he leaped from
his throne and cried aloud lest Poseidon, that shaketh
the world, should cleave asunder the earth, and the
habitations, abhorred even of the gods, stand revealed
unto mortals, ghastly and dank to view. So huge arose
the din of gods meeting in battle.
Full fronting King Poseidon stood Phoibos Apollo,
grasping his feathered shafts, while blue-eyed Athena
faced Enualios. Over against Hera stood clear-voiced
Artemis, archer-queen, sister of far-darting Apollo, with
her golden spindle; stout Hermes, the luck-bringer,
faced Leto; while over against Hephaistos rose the

great river, eddying deep, whom gods call Xanthos, and
men Skamandros¹.
75.] Thus god met god; but Achilles was burning to
plunge into the throng, to encounter Hektor, son of
Priam. His spirit prompted him to glut, with the foe-
man's blood, Ares, that warrior with stout bull-targe.
Then Apollo, that rouseth the nations, stirred up Aineias
to meet Peleus' son, and inspired lofty courage in him.
He took the voice of Lukaon, Priam's son; and, in his
likeness, thus did Apollo, son of Zeus, make utterance:-
'Aineias, councillor of Troy, where be thy boasts
which, over the wine-cup, thou didst make among the
Trojan princes, vowing to do battle with Achilles, son of
Peleus, face to face?'
85.] And thus did Aineias make reply:-
'Son of Priam, why biddest thou me fight, whether
I will or not, against the high-hearted son of Peleus?
Not this day for the first time shall I stand face to face with
Achilles, but ere now hath he driven me from Ida with
his spear, what time he smote our herds, and razed
Lurnessos and Pedasos. Howbeit Zeus saved me, who
dowered me with strength and swiftness of foot; else I
had been brought low beneath the hands of Achilles and
of Athena, who went before him and gave him salvation,

to tend his father's herds. Familiar examples occur in the O. T.

was sent to anoint him king. Agriculture and husbandry were alike
esteemed.

bidding him make havoc of the Leleges¹ and Trojans
with his bronze spear. Wherefore no man may do
battle with Achilles, for ever at his side standeth an Im-
mortal, who fendeth bane. And, in any case, his bolt
flieth true to the mark, nor stayeth its course or ever it
pierceth a man's flesh. Yet should some god make the
issue of war 3
even betwixt us, nor easily would he quell
me, nay, not though he vaunteth himself to be invul-
nerable '.'
Then spake the son of Zeus, King Apollo, on this
wise:-
Hero, go to, and pray thou also to the immortal
gods; men say that thou art the son of Aphrodite,
daughter of Zeus, while he is born of an inferior god-
dess; for the one is daughter of Zeus, but the other
is sprung of the aged god of the sea. Howbeit bear
straight at him thy tireless bronze, nor let him turn thee
aside one whit by sorry" words and cursing.'
110.] So saying he breathed great courage into the
shepherd of the folk; and through the foremost strode
he, arrayed in dazzling bronze. Yet not unmarked of
white-armed Hera did he move to meet Achilles through
the warrior host; wherefore she brought the gods
together, and hailed them thus :—

course must be. Yonder cometh Aineias, arrayed in

hath sent him forth. But come, let us turn him aside
straightway; or else it were well for one of us to stand
beside Achilles, and give him might; in no wise must he
fail in spirit, that he may know that the noblest of the
Immortals love him, and that they are but vain who,
aforetime, have succoured the Trojans in the time of
battle. All of us have come down from Olumpos to
join in this battle, lest Achilles suffer aught this day at
the hands of the Trojans; hereafter will he suffer all
those evils which Fate spun for him at birth, when his
mother bare him. But if Achilles will not receive this
by inspiration from heaven, then shall he be dismayed
when some god confronteth him in the battle; for terrible
are the gods in their appearing '.'
132.] Then did Poseidon, the Earth-shaker, answer
her:-
-
'Hera, let not thine anger bewray thy wit: that must
never be. For my part, I would not willingly bring the
gods together in strife. Rather let us retire from the
beaten way to some place of watch, and there sit down,
while war shall be the business of mortals. But if Ares
or Phoibos Apollo begin battle, or seek to stay Achilles
and suffer him not to fight, then straightway will conten-
tion and strife arise here even among us; and, methinks,

144.] Thus spake the blue-haired deity, and led the
way to the mound of divine Herakles, lofty, of heaped
up earth, which the Trojans and Pallas Athena built
that so he might shun the sea-beast¹ and make good his
flight, when it should chase him from shore to plain.
There sat Poseidon, and with him the other gods, their
shoulders girt with impenetrable cloud; while those on
the other side³ sat upon the brows of Kallikolônê, around
thee, Phoibos, and Ares that destroyeth cities.
153.] Thus they sat, on this side and on that, devising
counsels; yet both shrank from beginning ruthless war;
but Zeus, throned on high, was supreme over them.
And all the plain was filled with horses and warriors,
and with the glint of bronze; and the earth creaked
with the feet of men as they moved together.
Then two of the bravest, Aineias son of Achises and
godlike Achilles, met in the midst of the hosts, eager for
the fray. Foremost strode Aineias, with look of defiance,
nodding with ponderous helm; a stout targe he held
before his breast, and brandished a bronze spear. And
the son of Peleus rose from the other side to meet him,
like some fierce lion whom men are fain to slay, gathering
themselves together,-even all the hamlet; he at first,

open-jawed, foam hanging about his fangs, while
within him his stout heart groaneth, and with his tail he
lasheth flanks and haunches to left and right, and goad-
eth himself to battle; anon, with glaring eyeballs,
straight on he launcheth himself in his fury, if haply he
may slay some foeman, or perish himself in the forefront
of the throng¹: even so was Achilles spurred by might
and lofty spirit to meet high-hearted Aineias face to face.
176.] Now when they were come nigh to each other,
then swift-footed Achilles first accosted him after this
fashion:-
'Aineias, wherefore hast thou taken thy stand against
me so far to the front? art minded to do battle with me,
because thou hopest to be master of Priam's office
among the Trojans 2? Nay, if thou slay me, not for this
will Priam set his glory in thy hands; for he hath sons,
and he himself is stout of heart, not doting. Or is it
that the Trojans have set aside for thee some parcel of
land, excellent above the rest, rich in orchard and
plough-land, that thou mayst possess it, if thou slay
1 The most elaborate of all Homer's lion-similes. There is a similar
passage in Hesiod, Shield of Herakles, 430-1:-
γλαυκιόων δ᾽ ὄσσοις δεινὸν πλευράς τε καὶ ὤμους
οὐρῇ μαστιόων ποσσὶ γλάφει.
The constant allusion to lions (not now denizens of Europe) is to be
explained by the fact that they were once not uncommon in the Greek
settlements of Asia Minor, just as they were found in Palestine,
as readers of the O. T. will remember. Ancient writers (e. g. Pliny)
have noticed the lion's habit of lashing himself with his tail;
cf. Lucan i. 208:—
'Mox ubi se saevae stimulavit verbere caudae.'
The 'green malignant light' of an angry lion's eyes is admirably
suggested by the Homeric γλαυκιόων.
2 Viz., because you hoped to succeed to the throne, as a reward of
prowess.

me? I trow that were too hard a task.
Once ere now,
I boast, thou didst quail before my spear; hast thou for-
gotten how, when thou wert alone, I chased thee from
the oxen with flying step down from Ida's hills? In no
wise didst thou turn thee from thy flight on that day.
Thence thou fleddest to Lurnessos; yet, in quest of thee,
I destroyed that city,-with aid of Athena and father
Zeus, and carried away the women captives, robbing
them of freedom's day; howbeit Zeus and the other gods
delivered thee. But now, methinks, he will not shelter
thee, as thou deemest; wherefore I bid thee get back
into the throng, nor stand to meet me, lest mischief
betide thee. A fool learneth-too late.'
199.] And Aineias answered him, and spake :-
'Son of Peleus, think not to scare me with words, as
though I were a child, for I too know full well how to
utter both insult and seemly speech. We know each
other's lineage, we know each other's parents, having
heard the famous words of mortal men; but never sawest
thou my parents, nor I thine. They say thou art the son
of blameless¹ Peleus, and thy mother fair-haired Thetis,
the sea-queen; and I boast myself sprung of noble-
hearted Anchises, and Aphrodite is my mother. Of these
1 The word 'blameless' (åµúµwv) often occurs in Homer, generally
of kings who were by no means 'blameless' in the moral sense.
The
word signifies free from blemish, and was probably (as A. B. Cook
observes in his essays on 'The European Sky-God') a ceremonial
term applicable to the priest-king. The king who is ȧµúμwv has
a flourishing kingdom; the king who is maimed has a kingdom
diseased like himself. (Cf. Odyssey xix. 109 sqq.) 'The duties of
the king as representative of Zeus could be satisfactorily discharged
only by a man who was perfect and without blemish, by a man (that
is) in the prime of life, suffering from no defect of body or mind'
(Cook, loc. cit.). So of priests in O. T., Levit. xxi. 17, 18.

son; for not, I trow, with heedless words shall we part,
as now we are¹, returning from battle. Yet, if thou
wilt learn this also, to the end that thou mayst know
of our race (and many there be that know thereof):
Dardanos, son of cloud-gathering Zeus, was founder of
my line; and he builded Dardanie; for not as yet had
sacred Ilion risen on the plain to be a city of speaking
men, but they were still dwelling at the foot of many-
fountained Ida. And Dardanos begat a son, King
Erichthonios, wealthiest of mortal men; three thousand
mares had he, which pastured in the mead, rejoicing in
their tender foals. And behold, while they grazed,
Boreas loved them, and, in likeness of a dark-maned
steed, was mingled with them; and they conceived and
bare twelve she-foals. And when they flew over the
fruitful land, they would skim the tops of asphodel, yet
brake them not down; but when they flew over the
broad back of the sea, they would skim the top of the
hoar sea's surf. And Erichthonios begat Tros to be king
among the Trojans; and from Tros sprang three blame-

less sons, Ilos, and Assarakos, and godlike Ganumedes',
fairest of the sons of men. And so, because of his
beauty, the gods snatched him up to be cupbearer to
Zeus, that he might dwell with the Immortals. And Ilos
begat a blameless son, Laomedon; and Laomedon begat
Tithonos, and Priam, and Lampos, and Klutros, and
Hiketaon scion of Ares. And Assarakos begat Kapus,
and Kapus begat a son Anchises; and me Anchises
begat, and Priam begat godlike Hektor. Of such
lineage and blood I boast myself; but Zeus giveth ex-
cellency to men, aye and minisheth it; for he is supreme
over all.

children, standing here in the midst of the fierce conflict.
We both could mouth words of insult full many-enough
to sink even a galley of an hundred benches. Glib are

issue forth into the highway and quarrel, each with each,
reviling one another in words, some true, some false?
So anger prompteth. Howbeit, not with words wilt.

spears.'
259.] He spake, and flung his huge spear full at the
dreadful shield, with grim resolve; and loudly rang
the shield beneath the point of the spear. And the son
of Peleus with his broad hand held the shield at arm's
length, fearfully; for he deemed that the long-shadow-
ing spear of high-hearted Aineias would find easy
passage,-fool! for he remembered not that the glorious
gifts of heaven are not easily overcome by mortal men,
nor yield before them. So did not the massy spear of
warrior-souled Aineias break the targe; for the gold
thereof, a gift divine, averted it. Notwithstanding,
through two folds Aineias drave it; but three remained,
since the halt-foot god had wrought five folds, two of
bronze, two within of tin, and one of gold; and there
the ashen spear was stayed³.
273.] Next Achilles launched a long-shadowing spear,
and struck Aineias upon the orbed shield, close beneath
the outmost rim, where the bronze ran thinnest, and
thinnest lay the bull's hide beneath. Right through
sped the Pelian ash, and the shield below was rent with

a loud noise. Then did Aineias cower, and hold his
shield far from him, in dread; but the weapon, passing
over his back, was stayed in its eager flight in the
ground, yet tare asunder both layers¹ of his ample
shield. Then Aineias, having thus avoided the long
lance, stood up; but upon his eyes fell sorrow without
stint, and he trembled greatly, so close beside him
stood the lance. Onward then, with dreadful cry,
rushed Achilles in hot haste, his sharp sword drawn;
and Aineias seized upon a boulder, huge of mass, which
scarcely two men—as men are now-could raise; yet
did he, unaided, wield it with ease. Then would
Aineias with that stone have struck Achilles, as he
sprang upon him, on helm or targe-which, of a truth,
had saved him from bitter death; and him would the
son of Peleus have slain hard by with the sword, had
not Poseidon, the Earth-shaker, been quick to mark.
Straightway he addressed the Immortals:-
'Out upon it! woe is me for noble-hearted Aineias'
sake, who, slain by Achilles, will swiftly go down to
Hades, because, in his folly, he trusted to the words of
Apollo, the far-shooter; yet will Apollo not deliver him
from fell destruction! But why, alas! doth he, the
guiltless, suffer vainly for sorrows not his own,-he
who doth ever render to the gods, who dwell in wide
heaven, gifts freely offered?

should Achilles slay him. Fated is he to escape, that
the race of Dardanos perish not without seed, leaving
no trace, Dardanos, beloved of Zeus more than all his

sons, born to him of mortal women.
For already hath
he come to loathe the race of Priam; but hereafter the
might of Aineias shall rule over the Trojans, yea, both
Aineias and his children's children yet unborn '.'
309.] And mild-eyed Hera, the queen, answered
him :-
Earth-shaker, do thou thyself consider well whether
thou wilt save Aineias, or let him alone. For Pallas
Athena and I have sworn by many witnesses before all
the Immortals, that we will never fend the evil day from
the Trojans, not even when all Troy be kindled with
devouring flame, and Achaia's warrior sons set light
thereto.'
And it was so when Poseidon, that shaketh earth,
heard these words, he departed into the battle, amid
the din of spears, and came to the place where Aineias
and famous Achilles stood. Straightway about the
eyes of Achilles, son of Peleus, he shed a mist, and
drew the bronze-tipped ashen spear from the shield of
great-hearted Aineias; the spear he set down before
Achilles' feet, but Aineias he caught up aloft from
earth, and flung him swiftly away. And as Aineias
leaped from the god's hand, he flew over many a file of

may be assigned to any passages in the Iliad, it may be presumed that
the author of these verses knew of a line of princes ruling over some
remnant of the Trojans, and claiming Aeneas as their ancestor. But
these verses do not imply any removal to a distant settlement.' The
writer who first gave the idea of a Trojan settlement in Italy appears
to have been the poet Stesichoros (sixth century B. C.); but he knew
nothing of any settlement in Latium. This legend was of much later
growth. The Homeric prophecy was adapted by Virgil, Aen. iii.
97, 98 :-
'Hic domus Aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris,
Et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis.'

warriors, many a line of chariots, till he came to the
uttermost verge of impetuous war, where the Kaukônes
were arming for battle. Then did Poseidon, that shaketh
earth, draw nigh unto him, and call him by name
with winged words :-
332.] Aineias, what god biddeth thee, reft of thy
wits, to contend in battle against Achilles, at once thy
better and dearer to the gods? Nay, step back when-
soever thou meet him, lest, in fate's despite, thou come
to the house of Hades. Notwithstanding, when Achilles
meeteth death and doom, then do thou take heart, and
fight with the foremost; for none other of the Achaians
shall despoil thee.'
340.] So saying he left him there, when he had
opened all things unto him. Then swiftly he scattered
the mist divine from Achilles' eyes; and the hero
stared with wide open eyes, and, heavy of heart, thus
communed with his proud spirit :-
:-
'Out upon it! verily a great marvel is this that
I behold. My spear lieth here upon the ground, yet
I see not the man at whom I flung it, eager to slay. In
very truth, Aineias is beloved of the immortal gods¹;
yet I deemed his boast but idle. Let him go! Not
again will he, who hath now thankfully escaped death,
be fain to make trial of me. But come now, let me
encourage the valiant Danaoi and go forth to make trial
of the other Trojans.'
352.] He spake and flung himself along the ranks,
and shouted encouragement to each and all:-
-
'Stand now no more aloof from the Trojans, ye
gallant Achaians, but let each confront his foeman, and
be zealous for the fray. Hard is it for me, mighty
1 Sc., though I knew it not.'

though I am, to deal with so great an host, and to do
battle with all. Not Ares, an immortal god, nor
Athena's self, could face such a conflict and prevail.
Howbeit, in all that I may accomplish by hand and foot
and sheer strength, no more, I trow, shall I be slack,-
nay, not one whit; rather shall I cleave a path right
through the foemen's ranks; and none, methinks, of the
Trojans who cometh anigh my spear will rejoice.'
364.] Thus spake he, exhorting them; and glorious
Hektor called aloud upon the Trojans and cheered them
on, declaring that he would advance to meet Achilles :--
'Valiant-hearted Trojans, fear not the son of Peleus.
I, too, in words could do battle even with the Immortals,
but with the spear 'tis a hard matter, seeing they are
stronger far.
Not even Achilles will accomplish all his
words; this he will fulfil, that he will leave unfulfilled.
Him will I meet, even if his hands be as fire-aye even
as fire and his strength as shining steel.'
Thus spake he, exhorting; and the Trojans advanced
with uplifted spears; and the might of the warriors ³
was mingled together, and a shout of battle rose up.
375.] Then did Phoibos Apollo stand beside Hektor,
and say:-
"

conflict,' the metaphor being taken from the bit and bridle, as Leaf
supposes. Paley renders 'face the jaws of war,' remarking that the
phrase is a strange one,-as, indeed, it is.
2 Note the repetition here of the phrase (called by grammarians,
in their hideous jargon, 'epanalepsis'). Such repetition is often
highly effective, as we see in Milton, Paradise Lost, vii. 24 :—
'More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues.'

'Hektor, fight not at all in the forefront with Achilles,
but await him in the throng', amid the press of battle,
lest peradventure he thrust at thee and, close-countering,
smite thee with his sword.'
Thus spake he, and Hektor drew back into the
surging mass of warriors, fearfully, when he heard the
voice of the god. But Achilles, with shout terrific,
sprang among the Trojans, his heart clad with power.
And first he slew Iphition, brave son of Otrunteus, chief
of many peoples, whom a Naiad bare to Otrunteus,
ravager of cities, beneath snowy Tmolos, in Hudê's'
fertile plain. Him, as straight on he pressed, did god-
like Achilles smite with the spear, full in the forehead;
and the head was cloven asunder. With a crash he
fell, and godlike Achilles exulted over him :-
'Here liest thou, son of Otrunteus, of all men most
terrible. Here is thy place of death, though thy birth-
place is beside lake Guges, where is thine ancestral
heritage, beside the shore of fishy Hullos and eddying
Hermos³.'
393.] Thus vauntingly he spake; but darkness
covered his foeman's eyes. And the chariots of the
Achaians tare him in pieces with the tires of their
wheels in the front of battle; and, next after him,
Achilles pierced Demoleon, a brave war champion, in
the temple, sheer through the bronzen cheek-piece of

his helmet. Nor did the bronzen casque fend that
blow, but through it the flying spear brake bone, and all
his brain was scattered abroad within; so he mastered
him, for all his eagerness.
Next with his spear he wounded in the back Hippo-
damas, who had lighted from his chariot and was
fleeing before him; and he gasped out his life, bellow-
ing loud as a bull belloweth, when dragged round
the temple of Poseidon¹ by noble youths (in such
worshippers the earth-shaker delighteth): even so he
bellowed as his haughty spirit forsook his body.
407.] Then did Achilles move, spear in hand, against
godlike Poludoros, Priam's son. Him his father suffered
not in any wise to fight, because he was the youngest
of his children, and his best-beloved. None might
match him in swiftness of foot; now therefore, boy-like,
his speed displaying, rushed he through the foremost,
until he lost his life. Him did swift godlike Achilles
strike midmost his back, as he sped past, just where the
belt's golden clasps joined, and the corslet overlapped ³.
Right through, beside the navel, clave the spear's
point; and, with a shriek, he stumbled upon his knees,
and a dark cloud covered him about; and he sank down,
clutching his entrails to him.

entrance to the weapon. Cf. 1 Kings xxii. 34, 'A certain man drew

And it came to pass when Hektor beheld his brother
Poludoros holding his entrails in his hands, and sinking
to earth, that a darkness¹ fell upon his eyes; no longer
could he endure to stand aloof, but went to meet Achilles,
like a flame of fire, brandishing a sharp spear. And
Achilles marked him and leaped forth to the encounter,
and cried in exultation :-
'Lo here is the man who, above all others, hath wrung
my heart, even he who hath slain the friend I honoured.
No longer, methinks, can we shun each other along the
barriers of war.'
427.] He spake; then, with a scowl, accosted
Hektor:-
'Draw near, that thou mayst the swiftlier come to
the goal of death.'
Then up spake Hektor, unterrified :-
'Son of Peleus, think not to scare me with words, as
though I were a child, for I too know full well how to
utter both insult and seemly speech. I know that thou
art mighty, far mightier than I; yet of a truth it lieth
in the lap of heaven whether, weaker as I am, I shall
take away thy life with a spear cast,-for my weapon
also is sharp before my face?.'
He spake; then, poising, he launched his spear. But
Athena, with a breath, turned it back from glorious
Achilles, breathing full gently upon it; and it returned
to divine Hektor, and fell before his feet. And Achilles
sprang forth in his fury, eager to slay him, and with

a fearful cry. But Apollo snatched him away, lightly,
as a god might, and wrapped him in thick cloud. Thrice
did godlike Achilles, swift-footed, spring forth with
bronze spear, and thrice he smote but the depth of
air. Then, with dire upbraiding, he uttered winged
words:-
'Dog, yet again hast thou this day escaped death!
yet verily the evil came nigh. Now hath Phoibos
Apollo rescued thee again, to whom, belike, thou
prayest when thou goest into the clash of spears.
Know of a truth I shall meet thee, soon or late, and
make an end, if so be a god doth aid me also. Now
shall I make onslaught on the other Trojans, whomso-
ever I may find'.'
455.] Which said, he wounded Druops with a javelin
in the midst of his neck; and he sank at his feet.
Him he left there, and, with a cast of his spear against
the knee, stayed in his course Demouchos, Philetor's son,
a warrior brave and stalwart. Then, with a thrust of his
huge sword, he reft away his life. Next he rushed upon
Laogonos and Dardanos, sons of Bias, and thrust them
both to earth from out their chariots,-the one with
his spear, the other with a blow of his hanger. Then
he turned upon Tros, Alastor's son; the same had come
to clasp his knees, if haply he might spare him, a prisoner
taken, and let him go alive, and slay him not in com-
passion of his youth; fool! he knew not how vain such
prayer would prove. For no soft-hearted man was he,
nor easy to be entreated, but ruthless altogether. He
clasped Achilles by the knees, eager to make supplica-

tion; but the warrior struck him with his sword through
the liver; and his liver slipped from him, while black
blood, issuing therefrom, filled the fold of his vesture ¹.
Then darkness covered his eyes, and life fled.
472.] And now he stood beside Moulios, and with his
spear wounded him in the ear, and forthwith the bronze
point passed out through the other ear. Next with
hilted sword he smote Echeklos, Agenor's son, full on
the head, and all his sword was hot with blood; and
over his foeman's eyes fell the darkness of death and
mastering doom. After that, with bronzen point he
pinned Deukalion through the arm, where the sinews of
the elbow join; and he stood, with one arm disabled,
beholding death before his face. And Achilles struck
him in the neck with his sword, and smote afar off his
head, together with the casque; from his spine the
marrow spurted, as he lay stretched in the dust.
Then rose Achilles up against Rhigmos, blameless son
of Peireas, who had come from fertile Thrace; him he
struck in the middle with a javelin; and the bronze
stuck fast in his belly, and he fell from his chariot. And
as Areithöos, his squire, turned back his steeds, he
pierced him through the back with sharp spear, and
hurled him from the car; and his steeds were confounded.

terrible as a god, following hard upon his victims; and
the black earth ran with blood. And as when a man
hath yoked broad-browed steers, to tread out white
barley in a well-appointed threshing floor, swiftly is the
grain shelled beneath the feet of the lowing kine: so,
beneath the hand of high-souled Achilles, were his firm-
hooved steeds trampling down corpses and shields,-
a mingled heap¹. And the axle underneath was all
dashed with blood, and the rails that compassed the
chariot were splashed with drops thrown up by the
horses' hooves and by the tires.2 And on swept the son
of Peleus, to win him renown, his invincible hands
bedewed with gore.

the city, others to the river Skamandros. These latter he overtakes
and slaughters, reserving twelve as a sacrifice to the ghost of
Patroklos. Next he meets Lukaon, whom, in spite of his passionate
plea for mercy, he will not spare. His dead body Achilles flings into
the river. Immediately after, he falls upon Asteropaios, and slays
him. At this point the River-god, Skamandros, angered that his
stream should be blocked with the slain, attacks Achilles, who is
assisted in the combat by Pallas Athena and Poseidon. Simoes joins
Skamandros, whereupon the fire-god Hephaistos, at Hera's request,
wellnigh dries up the waters. The gods themselves engage one
another in fierce contest, during which Athena wounds Ares.
Meanwhile Achilles continues the havoc of his foes, and drives the
survivors into Troy. Agenor alone dares to withstand the hero;
who would have slain him had not Apollo conveyed him out of peril,
and then, to mock Achilles, taken the shape of Agenor. Achilles
pursues the disguised god, and so the Trojans are enabled to with-
draw within the city walls.

But when they were come to the ford of the fair-flowing
river, of eddying Xanthos, son of immortal Zeus, Achilles
cut the host in twain; some he pursued into the plain,

cityward, by the selfsame road whereon the Achaians were
flying distraught the day before when glorious Hektor
raged unhindered¹. There poured they forth, in panic
rout, and Hera shed before their path a deep mist, to
baffle them; while half were driven huddling into the
deep-flowing river with its silver eddies.
In fell they
with loud clamour; the sheer waters roared amain; the
banks re-echoed all about; and with confused cries they
sought to swim this way and that, whirled round in the
eddies.

As when before a rush of fire locusts take wing,
flying to the river; the unwearying fire, roused on the
sudden, burneth amain, while they shrink fearfully into
the water so, before Achilles, was the sounding stream
of eddying Xanthos choked with horses and men in their
confusion.
17.] Now the son of heaven left his spear upon the
bank, leaning upon a tamarisk bush, but himself leaped
in, a god in power, grasping his sword, with dire purpose
in his thoughts; right and left he smote; and there rose
up a terrible cry of men slain with the sword, and the
water was red with blood. As before a monstrous
dolphin other fishes flee, filling the bays of some
sheltering harbour in their terror'; for whatsoever fish
he catcheth he devoureth greedily: so along the grim
river's stream cowered the Trojans beneath the beetling

cliffs. And when his hands wearied of the slaughter, he
plucked twelve noble youths out of the river, as blood-
price for the death of Patroklos, Menoitios' son'.
These he led forth to land, fearful as fawns, and bound
their hands behind them with well-cut thongs, which
they themselves wore over their pleated doublets; and he
gave them unto his henchmen to take to the hollow ships,
while he himself bounded onward, athirst for slaughter.
34.] Then did he light upon a son of Priam fleeing
from the river,-Lukaon, whom erstwhile he himself
had captured and brought, all unwilling, from his father's
orchard, in a night onslaught. With a sharp axe³ he was
lopping a fig-tree's young boughs, to make him a chariot's
rims; but mischief unforeseen had befallen him, in the
guise of godlike Achilles. And that time he carried him in
ships to well-peopled Lemnos, and sold him there, and
Iêson's son bought him for a price. But a guest-friend
of his father, Eetion of Imbros, ransomed him for a goodly

sum, and sent him to divine Arisbe¹; escaping thence
in secret he came to his father's house. So he came
from Lesbos, and for eleven days made merry with his
friends; but on the twelfth day heaven delivered him yet
again into Achilles' hands, who was destined to send
him, reluctant, down to the house of Hades. Soon
as swift-footed divine Achilles beheld him, disarmed,
without helm or shield, and the spear was not in his
hand, but he had cast all his gear to earth (for as
he hasted from the river, sweat galled him, and his
knees beneath him were bowed for very weariness),
then, astonied, the hero communed with his mighty
heart :-
54.] 'Out upon it! verily a great marvel do mine eyes
behold here. In truth the high-hearted Trojans, whom
I slew, will rise again from the mirky gloom, even as
now yon wight hath returned, escaping the pitiless
day, albeit he was sold to goodly Lesbos! The grey
sea's depth stayed him not, which hindereth many against
their will. But come now, let him taste the point of my
spear, that I may see in my heart and be certified whether
from that realm 2 also he will return, or whether the life-
giving earth will hold him fast, which holdeth fast even
the mighty.'
64.] Thus he mused, biding his ground; but Lukaon
drew near, quaking, fain to clasp his knees; for he
desired with all his soul to escape fell death and black
fate. And divine Achilles raised his long lance, eager
to strike; but the other ran beneath, and, bending, clasped
his knees; and, behold, the spear passed over his back,

and stood fixed in the earth, although it yearned' to
glut itself on the flesh of a man.
And Lukaon with one
hand caught him, suppliant-wise, by the knees, while
with the other he grasped the pointed lance, and would
not let go thereof. Then he lifted up his voice and
uttered winged words :-
'I beseech thee, Achilles, have regard unto me and pity
me. Verily I am as a suppliant 2, thou son of Zeus, whom
thou must needs reverence. For it was at thy board
first that I tasted of Demeter's bread', that day when thou
didst seize me in that goodly orchard, and didst sell me,
carrying me captive to fair Lesbos, far from sire and
friends, where for ransom I gat thee the price of an
hundred bullocks". And now, after that I had been
ransomed for thrice so much-and, behold, it is but the
twelfth day since I came to Ilion, after suffering many
things-yea, now, a cruel fate hath set me once more in
thy hands. Surely I must be hateful in the eyes of
Father Zeus, who hath given me to thee again. For
a scant space did my mother Laothoë, daughter of old
Altes, bear me,-Altes, who ruleth over the warlike
Leleges, in high-built Pedasos, beside the stream of
Satnioeis. Priam wedded his daughter, and many another

2 Though a captive, he had eaten bread at the table of Achilles ;
and this fact entitled him to the respect (aidós) due to a έévos. Though
not actually a suppliant, Lukaon regards himself as being 'as good as

also; and of her two sons were born, and thou-wilt
slaughter both. Him, my brother, thou didst slay amid
the foremost warriors, even godlike Poludoros, when
thou smitedst him with thy sharp spear; and now, verily,
evil will befall me here; for methinks I shall not escape
thy hands, for fate hath sent thee against me. But I will
tell thee another thing, and do thou lay it to heart: slay
me not, seeing I am not own brother unto Hektor, who
killed thy comrade, gentle and brave.'
97.] So spake Priam's noble son unto Achilles,
praying earnestly; but harsh the word that fell upon his
ear :-
'Thou fool! tender me no ransom, nor speak thereof.
Or ever Patroklos met his day of doom, I loved rather
to spare the Trojans, and took many alive and sold
them into slavery; but now not one may escape death,
whomsoever heaven hath put into my hands before
Ilion,-nay, not one of all the Trojans, but chiefly of the
sons of Priam. Nay, my friend', die like another;
why wail in vain? Patroklos, too, is dead, thy better

abrupt transitions of feeling are quite in accord with Achilles' character.
The consciousness of the ancient world was'' full to the brim of the
sad mortality of this sunlit world' (James, Varieties of Religious
Experience, p. 86). The cruelty and the sympathy of Achilles each
rings true; they do not mix nor interfere with each other.
It is not surprising that these wonderful words of Achilles should
have been famed in antiquity. Like those great expressions of ele-
mental human sorrow that we find so often in the Old Testament,
they echo over the gulf of centuries, majesties poignant and beautiful
as on the day when they were first uttered. (Read Murray's fine
criticisms in The Rise of the Greek Epic2, pp. 162 foll.)
2 Cf. Zech. i. 5, 'Your fathers, where are they? and the
prophets, do they live for ever?' Lucretius iii. 1042 (imitating this

114.] Thus he spake, and the knees and dear heart
of Lukaon sank straightway. He dropped his spear,
and sat with outstretched hands. Then did Achilles
draw his sharp sword, and smote him on the neck
beside the collar-bone, and all the two-edged blade
sank deep. Prone upon the ground he lay, stretched
out; and black blood began to flow, bedewing the
earth. And Achilles seized him by the foot, and flung
him into the river, there to drift; and, exulting over
him, he uttered winged words :-
'Lie now there, with the fish for comrades, who
shall lick the blood from off thy wound, careless of thy
fate. No mother shall lay thee upon thy bed, making
lamentation, but Skamandros in his whirling stream shall
carry thee to the sea's broad bosom. Many a fish,
leaping through the waves, will dive beneath the

dark ripple, after supping upon Lukaon's white fat.
Perish all the sort of you, till we reach the city of sacred
Ilion, ye in flight, and I dealing death in the rear!
The fair-flowing river with its silver eddies shall not
succour you, in whose honour ye have long been
sacrificing many a bull, and have sunk alive in the
eddies thereof firm-hooved steeds¹. Nay, even so shall
ye perish miserably, till ye have all made atonement
for the slaughter of Patroklos and the ruin of the
Achaians whom ye slew by the hollow ships apart
from me 2.
136.] So he spake; and the anger of the river-god
was kindled against him, and he cast about in his
heart how to stay godlike Achilles from his bloody
work, and fend ruin from the Trojans. Meantime the
son of Peleus, grasping his long-shadowing spear, flung
himself upon Asteropaios, Pelagon's son, in eagerness
to slay him; he was son of wide-flowing Axios³ and
Periboia, eldest of the daughters of Akessamenos, with
whom the deep-eddying River had mingled in wedlock.
Achilles rushed upon his foe, who, coming forth out of
the river to face him, stood his ground, holding a brace
of spears. And Xanthos put courage in his heart, for
idea being that the corpse will soon float on the surface, where the
fish will come up to feed upon it.

Saint Foix relates that when Bertrand du Guesclin was buried
at St. Denis in the year 1389, several horses were sacrificed, after
being first blessed by the Bishop of Auxerre. Among the ancient
Greeks, however, the sacrifice seems to have been made to a water-
god only-why, it is not easy to guess. The great Vedic horse-sacri-
fice (açvamedha) was intended to strengthen the temporal power of
kings.

he was wroth for the slaughtered warriors whom
Achilles had slain within his stream, pitilessly. And
when they were come nigh unto each other, swift-footed
godlike Achilles was foremost to speak :-
'Who and whence art thou, that darest to face me?
Unhappy the sires whose sons encounter my might!'
152.] Then up spake Pelagon's noble son:-
'Great-hearted Achilles, why askest thou of my race?
I come from fertile Paioniê¹, a far land, leader of the
long-speared Paionians; and behold this is the eleventh
day since I came to Ilion. My descent is from wide-
flowing Axios, sire of Pelagon, the spear-renowned;
and he, men say, begat me. Now therefore let us fight,
glorious Achilles.'
161.] Thus spake he, threatening; and godlike
Achilles raised the Pelian ash, but the hero Asteropaios
cast both his spears at once, for double-handed was he.
With the one he smote the shield; howbeit it pierced
not through, for the gold-heaven's gift-stayed it.
With the other he grazed the forepart of Achilles'
right arm, and forth gushed dark blood; but the spear,
passing over his body, stood rooted in the ground,
thirsting to taste flesh. Next Achilles launched at
Asteropaios his straight-flying ashen spear, eager to
slay him; the man he missed, but struck the high
bank, and plunged the ashen shaft, driven half home³,
into the bank. Then the son of Peleus drew the sharp
sword from his thigh, and leaped upon him in his rage;

and he could not, for all his hand was stout, wrench the
ash of Achilles from the cliff. Thrice he shook it, in
his eagerness to drag it out, and thrice relaxed his
effort; the fourth time he was minded to bend the ashen
spear of Aiakides till it should break; but Achilles,
preventing him, took away his life with the sword.
For he smote him in the belly, by the navel, and all his
bowels gushed out; and darkness covered his eyes as
he lay gasping. Then did Achilles, leaping on his
breast, strip him of his harness, and cry aloud
vauntingly :-
184.] 'So lie there! verily it is hard for thee, though
sprung of a River-god, to strive with the sons of all-
puissant Zeus. Thou boastedst thyself to be the offspring
of a wide-flowing river, but I proclaim my lineage to be
from mighty Zeus. My father was Peleus, son of
Aiakos, master of the many Murmidons; and Aiakos
was a son of Zeus. Therefore, since Zeus is mightier
than all rivers that flow seaward, so is, the generation
of Zeus mightier than any river-child. Behold, thou
hast a mighty river to hand, if that may aught avail;
howbeit it is not possible to fight against the son of
Kronos, with whom even lordly Acheloïos may not
cope, nor the vast strength of deeply-flowing Okeanos¹,
from whom issue all rivers, and every sea, all fountains,
and deep wells. Yet even he feareth the levin of great

plane-an idea that would be naturally suggested by the appearance
of the horizon as it is seen in any extensive view, especially from
a mountain height. This plane was encircled by the Ocean, a broad
and deep river, which was the parent of all waters; and this stream
flowed continuously onward, so that in its revolving course it is spoken
of as returning upon itself (aóppoos, Iliad xviii. 399).' Tozer, History
of Ancient Geography, p. 20.

200.] He spake, and drew the bronze spear from
the bank; but the dead man he left there, lifeless, lying
upon the sands, wet with the dark water. About him eels
and fishes were busy, plucking at the fat upon his reins
for food. Then moved, Achilles against the horse-
plumed Paionians, who had scattered in flight¹ beside
the eddying river when they marked their champion in
the cruel fray fallen before the hand and sword of
Achilles. There he slew Thersilochos and Mudon
and Astupulos, Mnesos and Phrasios, Ainios and
Ophelestes; and swift Achilles had slain yet more, had
not the deep-eddying River, in guise like unto a man,
addressed him with wrathful. words, crying aloud out of
the deep eddy:-
214.] ‘Achilles, as thou art strong beyond all men so
thou doest foul deeds beyond all; for ever do the Gods
themselves help thee. If in sooth the son of Kronos
hath granted thee utterly to destroy the Trojans, do thou
at least drive them out of my stream and wreak thy deeds
of bale in the plain. For now are my pleasant streams
filled with corpses, nor can I anywhere pour my current
to the divine sea, straitened as I am with the dead, while
thou slayest in all-consuming wise. Go to now, and let
be; I am horror-smitten, thou chieftain of the folk.'
Then did swift-footed Achilles make answer, and say:-
'Even as thou biddest, heaven-born Skamandros,
so shall it be². Yet will I not cease from slaying the

River-god.

haughty Trojans, or ever I have penned them within
their city, and have tried issue with Hektor, face to
face,-whether he shall subdue me, or I him.
227.] With such words he rushed upon the Trojans,
in might a god. Then did the deep-eddying River thus
accost Apollo:-
:-
'Out upon it, thou son of Zeus, lord of the silver bow!
thou hast not kept the behest of Kronos' son, who strictly
bade thee stand by the Trojans and succour them, until
late-falling even should come and shadow the fertile
land.'
He spake, and spear-famed Achilles leaped into the
midst of the river, down-darting from the bank; but the
River-god rose upon him with swelling waters, rousing
all his currents in that fierce onset; so that he thrust
onward many corpses, thickly crowded there in the
stream-men slain by Achilles. Others he cast forth
on dry land, with a roar like the roaring of a bull'; but
the living he kept safe in his fair streams, hiding them
in the deep huge eddies. But about Achilles rose the
wave, grim and wild', and falling upon his shield beat
him back so that he could not make firm his footing.
With his hands he gripped an elm, well-grown and lofty,
which, wrenched from its roots, had split all the bank,
and barred the fair streams with its tangled branches,
and dammed the very river, fallen, as it was, all within
its waters. And Achilles, springing from out the eddy",

of their violence and noise; and the Latins imitated them. Thus

sped on his feet swiftly over the plain; for he was
sore afraid. Yet did not the mighty River cease, but
rose up against him with dark-crested wave', to stay
godlike Achilles from his work and fend ruin from the
Trojans.
250.] And the son of Peleus sprang away about
a javelin's cast, swooping as doth a black eagle, that
bird of prey, strongest and fleetest of feathered fowls.
Like him he flew, and the bronze rang fearfully upon his
breast; cowering 2, he fled before the River, and the River,
pouring amain, followed upon him with mighty roar. As
when from some darksome spring a ditcher³ heweth a
course for the water over plants and garden-plots, casting
out each stoppage from the channel, spade in hand;
beneath the forward-gliding stream all the pebbles are
carried down and speedily the trickling water bubbleth
over the sloping ground, too quick even for the guiding
hand so ever did the wave of the stream overtake
Achilles, for all his nimbleness. Verily the Gods are
mightier than men! Oft as swift-footed godlike Achilles
essayed to stand his ground and learn if all the Immortals
who dwell in the broad sky were leagued in pursuit, so

that precedes it, is finely wrought. Cf. Virgil's description of land-
irrigation in Georg. i. 106 foll. :—
'And when the parched field swells with dying blades,
Lo, from the brow of some steep ridgy slope
He charms the waters, which, as they fall, awake
A murmuring hoarse amid the polished stones.'
The picture is one well known to travellers in Alpine valleys. Note
that the comparison in the Homeric simile consists in the water being
quicker than the man in each case.

often did the mighty wave of the rain-fed river beat upon
his shoulders above; in anguish of heart would he
spring upward; but the blusterous stream, sliding
beneath, would bow his knees, and sweep away the
gravel under his feet.
272.] Then the son of Peleus groaned, with eyes cast
up to the wide heaven :-
'Alas, my father Zeus, that none of the gods will come
and save me, in my grievous plight, from the River!
Afterward let come what may¹. Not one of the Heavenly
Ones is so guilty, I trow, as my dear mother who soothed
me with lying words, declaring that, beneath the wall of the
mail-clad Trojans I should perish by Apollo's swift bolts.
Would that Hektor, bravest of all men in this land, had
slain me! then brave alike had been slayer and slain.
But now am I fated to be caught by a sorry death³,
whelmed in a mighty river, like a swineherd's son swept
away by a mountain torrent as he fordeth it in the storm.'
284.] So spake he; and, without ado, Poseidon and
Athena guised in mortal form came and stood nigh unto
him, and took him by the hand assuring him. And thus
Poseidon, the earth-shaker, began:-
¹ Achilles, eager to die in the field of battle, prays to be delivered
from an ignoble death.

'Oh, Diomed, thou bravest of the Greeks,
Would I had fallen, victim of thy spear,
Far on the plains of Troy, where Hector fell
Slain by Achilles !'
* Contrast, with this horror felt by Achilles at the thought of
perishing in a river, the curious remark of Aristotle, in the Ethics, that
the Kelts fear neither waves nor earthquakes. Cf. Hardie, Lectures
on Classical Subjects, chap. i ('The feeling for Nature in Greek and
Roman poets'); and Henry's Aeneidea i. 327–31.

'Son of Peleus, shrink not overmuch, nor be thou
dismayed. For verily we twain, Pallas Athena and I,
are thy defenders, and Zeus consenteth. It is not thy
doom to become the prey of a River-god; quickly will
he grant respite; thyself shall know it. Shrewd counsel
will we give, if thou wilt hearken unto us: hold not thy
hands from equal-balanced warfare, till thou have driven
within the famous walls of Ilion the host of Troy, even
all that shall escape. And do thou take Hektor's life,
and hie thee back to the ships. Behold, we yield thee
that glory for thy meed.'
298.] They ended speaking, and joined the Immortals;
and Achilles pursued his way to the plain, for the bidding
of the Gods mightily urged him on. Now it was so that
the whole plain was filled with the flood's overflow, and
much fair harness and many corpses of men slain in
battle were floating therein; but Achilles sprang aloft,
as he pressed forward in his course against the stream;
for Athena had put great might within him. Yet did not
Skamandros abate his fury, but was incensed the more
against the son of Peleus; and, high uplifted, he reared
the wave of his stream to a crest, and with a loud cry
called upon Simoeis:-
'Dear my brother, let us both together check this
mortal's strength¹; else will he swiftly sack King Priam's
great city, and the Trojans will abide not in the moil
of battle. Nay, help me and that right soon; fulfil all

Achilles, storming from on high, a confusion of foam
and blood and dead men. And the troubled wave of
the rain-fed river rose up and stood in an heap, and made
as if to destroy the son of Peleus. And Hera cried
aloud, for she feared for Achilles lest the mighty River,
with its deep eddies, should sweep him away; and
straightway she called to her dear son :-
'Get thee up, Halt-foot, my child; for we deemed
that it was against thee that the eddying Xanthos was
well matched in battle 5. Haste thee to help, and
manifest thy fierce flame. Behold, I will go and rouse
from the sea the strong blast of the west wind and of
the bright south, to consume alike the heads of the men
of Troy and their armour -a blast bearing with it

have no burial. The x@ots will be sufficiently performed by the river.

a baleful fire. And do thou burn up the trees by the
banks of Xanthos, and set the River himself in flame;
let him not turn thee aside at all with honeyed words
and cursing; nor check thy fury till I lift up my voice
and cry aloud; then stay the unwearying fire.'
342.] She ended; and Hephaistos made ready celestial
fire. First the fire was kindled on the plain, and con-
sumed the corpses'. And all the plain was parched
up, and the bright water was stayed. As when in
autumn days the north wind drieth soon an orchard
freshly watered, and the tiller rejoiceth: so swiftly was
all the plain dried up, and the dead were consumed.
And Hephaistos turned the all-shining flame into the
river. Burned were the elms, the willows, and the
tamarisks; burned, too, the lotus, the rushes, and the
tamarisks, which grew abundant by the fair waters of
the river; and the eels and fishes, that moved amid the
eddies and the fair streams, plunged, now here now
there, grievously tormented by the breath of cunning
Hephaistos. And the might of the River was con-
sumed, and he cried aloud and said :-
'Hephaistos, no god may pit himself against thee;
nor would I fight against thee thus blazing with fire.
Cease from strife, and let godlike Achilles drive forth-
with the Trojans from their city. What lot have I in
strife or aid?'
361.] He spake, scorched with the flame; and his fair
streams bubbled up. As a cauldron boileth, urged by
a fierce fire, wherein the fat of some well-fed hog is
seething; all around it spurteth up, and underneath
are set dry faggots: even so were his fair streams
aflame with fire, and his waters a-boil. Nor had he

a mind to flow on, but was held in check: for the fiery
breath of strong Hephaistos, that wise god, sore troubled
him. Then with winged words, he made earnest
supplication unto Hera:-
'Hera, wherefore hast thy son laid hands on my
stream, to torment it beyond all others? Less have
I offended than all the rest who aid the Trojans. But
in sooth I will cease, if such thy bidding; but let
yonder god also cease. Moreover, I will swear that
never hereafter will I avert from the Trojans the day of
doom, nay not even if all Troy be burning, wrapped in
fierce fire, lit by the warlike sons of Achaia.'
377.] And it was so, when the goddess, white-armed
Hera, heard this, that she spake to Hephaistos, her
well-loved son :—
'Hephaistos, my glorious son, stay thine hand; for it
is not meet to vex an immortal god thus for mortals'
sake.'
So said she, and Hephaistos quenched his raging
fire, and his fair streams sped to their wonted
channel ³.
Now when the might of Xanthos was tamed, the
twain ceased; for Hera, despite her anger, held them
back; but among the other gods grim strife fell heavy,
and passions within them were blown this way and

that. With vast crash they met, and the wide earth
rang, and the boundless welkin sounded as with
a trumpet¹. And Zeus, sitting on Olumpos, heard;
and he laughed aloud for joy when he beheld the gods
meeting in strife. No long while stood they apart, for
Ares, shield-piercer, led the way, who foremost rushed
upon Athena, grasping a bronze spear, and uttered
a bitter reproach :-
'Wherefore, O thing of shame', settest thou the gods
at strife, vehement in thy daring, thrall of thine own
proud spirit? Dost thou forget how thou didst prompt
Diomed, the son of Tudeus, to wound me, and, with
visible spear, didst thrust full at me, and tear my fair
flesh? Now, I warrant me, thou shalt requite that
deed.'

aegis, which even the bolt of Zeus pierceth not; it was

as men of old set for a boundary-mark. With this she

struck fierce Ares on the neck, and loosened his limbs.
Prostrate he lay over seven furlongs, his locks marred
with dust, and his harness clattered about him. And
Pallas Athena laughed aloud, and vaunted over him
with winged words :-
'Fool! never yet hast thou bethought thee how
far mightier I am, thou that wilt dare to match thy
might with mine. So¹ shalt thou fulfil thy mother's
curses, who, in her wrath, seeketh to do thee evil
because thou didst abandon the Achaians, and helpest
the proud Trojans.'

shining eyes.
But Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, took
him by the hand and led him away, moaning bitterly,
his senses scarce recovered. And when the goddess,
'No other word he spake; but one huge stone
He spied, a huge old stone that chanced to lie

and Hera had always been on this side, but not on account of
the Judgement of Paris, which was unknown to the author of the
Iliad.

winged words to Athena :-
'Ha, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, that never tirest, yet
again doth that thing of shame lead Ares, bane of men,

Thus she spake, and Athena hasted in pursuit,
rejoicing; and coming upon her she struck her in the
bosom with ample hand; and her limbs and dear
heart gave way.
There lay both upon the fruitful
earth; and Athena, exulting over them, uttered winged
words :-
'Now may it be thus with all' that aid the Trojans,
when they do battle with the mailed Achaians, even all
that be so bold and insolent as Aphrodite, who came to

since had we surceased from war, and sacked Ilion's

Apollo :-

It were a shameful thing if we gat us back to Olumpos,

Troy when we came from Zeus and became thralls to
proud Laomedon one full year, for a fixed wage, and he
laid upon us his behests. I built the Trojans a wall
about their city, broad and fair, that it should bide im-
pregnable; and thou, Phoibos, didst tend the horned
sway-footed kine in the glens of woody, many-folded Ida.
But when the joyous seasons brought to an end the term
of hire, then the fell Laomedon robbed us of our wage,
and cast us off with threats¹. He threatened to bind us,
hands and feet, and bear us off to far islands in slavery;
he boasted, too, that he would lop the ears of both with
the bronze. So we returned, hearts full of malice,
angered because of the guerdon promised but unpaid.
In return for this, thou showest now favour to his people,
nor seekest thou with us utterly to destroy the haughty
men of Troy, with their little ones and their chaste
wives.'

darter :-

I fight because of wretched mortals who, like the

Apollo and Poseidon, and their year's servitude, was celebrated
in antiquity; it is referred to in the seventh book of the Iliad (452).
2 A wanton piece of barbarity, and doubtless so regarded by
the Greeks of a later epoch. As Emerson says, in his essay on
worship (in the Conduct of Life), the Greek poets did not hesitate
to let loose their petulant wit even on the deities. Religion cannot
rise above the state of the votary; heaven always bears some
proportion to earth.

whatever the principle of their administration may be, and it often
varies with the mood or passion of the moment, their primary

from warfare; let them fight unaided.'
So saying he turned away; for he deemed it a shame-
ful thing to close in strife with his father's brother. But
his sister Artemis, the huntress-queen of the chase,
upbraided him with bitter words :-
'So then thou fleest, Far-darter, and to Poseidon hast
surrendered all the victory, and given him for nought 2
a ground of boasting! Thou fool, why graspest thou an
ineffectual bow? Let me hear thee no more in my father's
house, vaunting, as aforetime, among the immortal gods,
that thou wouldest do battle with Poseidon, face to face.'
She spake, but far-darting Apollo answered not a word;
but the chaste spouse of Zeus, in deep anger, thus
replied:-

against me? Verily I am hard for thee to rival in
might, even though thou hast a bow, since Zeus made
thee to be a lioness against women and gave thee to slay

whom thou wilt among them. Safer to despoil fierce
beasts among the hills, and wild deer, than to fight thy
betters. But if thou wilt learn about war, have thy will,
that thou mayest know how far stronger am I, seeing thou
dost match thy might with mine.'
489.] So spake she, and with her left hand gripped
both the hands of Artemis by the wrist, while with her
right she stripped the bow and arrows from her
shoulders; then with those very weapons beat her about
the ears, laughing as she dipped her head this way and
that; and the swift arrows kept falling from the quiver.
And the goddess, weeping the while, fled before her like
a wood-pigeon which flies before a hawk into some hollow
cleft of the rock'; yet is she not fated to fall a prey:
even so fled the goddess, weeping, and left bow and
arrows there 2.

One, to Leto :-

Reminiscences of this goddess-queen of the hills still
survive in modern Greece, as Lawson has shown in his Modern Greek
Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion, chap. ii, § 10. For Artemis in
her rôle as a goddess of wild life in nature, see Frazer's Golden Bough³
('The Magic Art,' vol. i, pp. 35 sqq.). As regards the word λéovra,

the form of a lion.

as a bird unto the hill?'
2 Leaf describes this passage as one of the few passages in the
Iliad which can be pronounced poetically bad. 'True,' replies
Murray (Rise of the Greek Epic2, p. 286), yet the badness lies entirely
in the taste, not in the execution. The verses are admirably written.
But the poet was not writing about anything that he felt as real, or as
mattering much to anybody's feelings. He was almost writing parody
or mock-epic. And he made it quite pretty!'

Thus he; and Leto gathered together the curved bow
and arrows that were lying in confusion amid the whirling
dust. These she took, and returned to her daughter', who
hied her to Olumpos, to the bronze-floored home of Zeus.
Weeping the maiden sat on her father's knees, and the
immortal vesture quivered about her. And her father,
son of Kronos, drew her to him, and, with laughter
sweet, asked:-
"
My child, who of the Heavenly ones hath done thee
this wrong?'
And the fair-crowned goddess, that lifteth her voice
in the chase, made answer:-
'Father, thy wife hath mishandled me, white-armed
Hera, from whom proceed strife and quarrel among the
Immortals.'
Such parley they held together; but Apollo alone²
entered holy Ilion, for he feared for the wall of the well-
built city lest the Danaoi, overstepping fate, should
sack it that day. Meanwhile the other gods, that live
for ever, came unto Olumpos, some in angry mood, some
greatly exulting, and sat down beside dark-clouded
Zeus.

up to the wide heaven, driven by the wrath of gods¹; to
all it bringeth suffering, and woes to many: even so
Achilles wrought lamentation and woe upon the Trojans.
And Priam, that old man, stood upon the godbuilt
rampart and marked giant Achilles, before whom the
Trojans rushed in tumultuous flight, nor was there any
strength in them; and with a bitter cry he hasted down
from the rampart, commanding thus the sturdy warders
of the gate that stood hard by the wall:-
'Hold ye wide the gates, until the people, that now
flee toward the city, be come; for lo, Achilles is nigh,
driving them helter-skelter before him: dire deeds will
shortly be accomplished. But when they be gathered
within the wall, and have found a breathing-space, shut
to the close-fitting doors; for I fear lest that man of
blood leap within the wall.'
537.] He spake, and they loosed the gates and drew
back the fastenings; the doors, spread wide, wrought
deliverance for the fugitives. And Apollo sprang forth
to meet them, that he might fend off their doom. But
they, parched with thirst, and cumbered with dust, were
coming from the plain straight for the city and its high
wall; while Achilles was pressing hot upon them with
his sword, and fierce madness filled ever his heart, and
he lusted to win renown.
Then had the sons of Achaia captured high-towered
Troy, had not Phoibos Apollo roused Agenor, Antenor's
blameless and gallant son, and put courage in his heart,
and himself stood at his side, to fend him from Death's

heavy hands', as, wrapt in thick mist, he leaned against
the oak-tree. Soon as he beheld Achilles, destroyer of
cities, he stood; but his heart the while was troubled;
and, sore perplexed, thus communed he with his
mighty soul:-
'Woe is me! if I flee before stout Achilles, where
the rest are rushing in wild amaze, even so will he take
me and butcher me as a craven. Yet should I leave
these to be routed utterly by Achilles, Peleus' son, and
on my feet flee away from the wall toward the level
plain, till I come to the glades of Ida³ and creep among
the brakes; then, peradventure, at eventide, I may
wash in the river, and, the sweat cooled from off me,
return to Ilion. But why doth my mind thus hold
converse with itself? I fear lest he mark me as I hurry
plainward from the city, and fly upon me and overtake
me with swift feet; then no longer shall I be able to
escape death and the fates, for very mighty is he beyond
all other. But what if I meet him face to face before
the city? surely his flesh also may be pierced with the
sharp bronze; a single life is his, and men say that he
is mortal ¹.'

to the plain of the Skamandros, and follow it up till he reaches the
glades and foot-hills of Ida (so Leaf).

571.] With that he gathered himself together', to
await Achilles; and his stout heart was eager for con-
flict and war. As a panther issueth out of a deep
jungle to meet the hunter, nor is dismayed nor fleeth,
soon as she heareth the baying hounds; for though
her adversary forestall her by thrust or cast, yet even
so, when transfixed, with the spear through her, she
bateth not her might till she close with him or die:
even so godlike Agenor, noble Antenor's son, scorned
to flee till he had proved Achilles. Before him he held his
full-orbed shield, and poised his spear for aim, then
shouted aloud:-
:-
'Doubtless thy hope, glorious Achilles, is this day to
sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool! many a woe
will yet be accomplished because of her. For we
therein be many and stalwart warriors, who, to protect
our loved parents, our wives, and our sons, will defend
Ilion. Here shalt thou meet thy doom, terrible though
thou art and a bold warrior.'
590.] He spake, and launched a sharp javelin from
his heavy hand, and smote his foe upon the shin, below
the knee, with sure aim; and the greave of new-wrought
tin rang fearfully upon him; howbeit the point
rebounded from the smitten hero, and pierced not
through; the heavenly armour fended the blow. Next
the son of Peleus sprang at Agenor; yet Apollo
suffered him not to win renown, but caught Agenor
away and covered him in thick mist, and so fetched
him from the fray in peace.
And Apollo drew the son of Peleus from the people
with a guile; for the Far-darter, in very guise of

Agenor, stood before him, and Achilles hasted in
pursuit. Over the corn-clad plain he swept pursuing,
and drave Apollo aside along the banks of deep-eddy-
ing Skamandros, the god outstripping him a scant
space. Thus by guile Apollo lured him, that he might
hope to catch him by speed of foot. Meantime the
Trojans, panic-smitten, came massing to the city, glad
at heart; and the town was filled with fugitives. Nor
did they dare any longer to await one another outside
the city wall, to learn who had escaped and who was
fallen in battle; so hastily did all, whomsoever feet and
nimble knees had saved, pour into the city.

THE DEATH OF HEKTOR.
The Trojans once safe within the circuit of the city walls, Hektor
stays alone to meet Achilles. To no purpose do his father and
mother entreat him to forgo the dread contest. At the approach of
Achilles, Hektor's resolution fails him and he flies; while his foeman
thrice pursues him round the city. Zeus weighs in golden scales
the lots of the two champions; and Hektor is doomed to die. Apollo
thereupon forsakes him, while Athena comes down to aid Achilles.
Hektor is slain; and Achilles, after exulting over his fallen enemy,
drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of his weeping
parents. Andromache, aroused by their lamentations, comes out of
the palace and mounts the wall. She swoons at the sight of her
dead husband; then gives way to passionate grief.

No other single book of Homer is, perhaps, more comprehensively
typical,' says Jebb (Introduction to Homer, p. 33). The same writer
is careful to point out that, in its swift action, we may recognize at
least four general traits as pre-eminently Homeric: (1) the distinctness
of the character drawing; (2) the blending of divine and human
agencies; (3) the appropriate and impressive use of similes at the
various crises in the narrative; (4) the way in which the poet brings
the fierce scenes of war into sharp relief against the touching pictures
of domestic love and sorrow. Cf. also Jebb's lectures on The Growth
and Influence of Greek Classical Poetry (1893), pp. 65-71.

quenched their thirst, resting against the goodly breast-
works; and the Achaians drew nigh unto the wall, their
shields sloped upon their shoulders'. But a fell fate
rooted Hektor to the spot, fronting Ilion and the
Skaian gates.
Then spake Phoibos Apollo to the son of Peleus :-
'Why, son of Peleus, pursuest thou me on swift feet,
thou mortal, me Immortal? Not even yet thou know-
est me for a god, but ragest with ardour unabated.
Thou carest no whit to slaughter the Trojans whom
thou didst drive before thee; lo, even now they be
gathered into the city; but thou hast turned aside
hither. Me thou canst not slay, since Death hath no
dominion over me.'
In high wrath thus answered swift-footed Achilles :-
'Thou hast foiled me, Far-darter, most deadly' of all
gods, turning me now hither from the wall; else many
had bitten the dust or ever they were come to Ilion. Me
thou hast robbed this day of great glory; but these
thou hast saved, with a light heart, seeing thou fearedst
In the eyes of an ancient Greek it was the figure of Achilles, with
his mingled tenderness and barbarity, that not only chained their
supreme attention but claimed their sympathy and admiration. Yet
to a modern it is Hektor throughout, fighting against impossible odds,
who wins our deepest regard. It is in the twenty-second book that we
are most acutely conscious of the direction in which our sympathies
lie. But, as Leaf points out, the presence of the gods on Achilles'
side was a tangible sign to an ancient Greek audience that their hero
was fighting the great fight of Hellenism against barbarism.

the city; swiftly he moved, like some charioted steed
in quest of a prize, who lightly scoureth the plain at full
stride: so nimbly did Achilles ply foot and knee.
Him the aged Priam was first to mark as onward he
swept across the plain, glittering like the star' that
goeth forth in time of harvest, the beams whereof, far
seen, shine forth amid the starry host in the dim
twilight; Orion's dog men call it,-brightest of stars,
but a sign of bale, and fraught with much fever³ unto
wretched mortals: even so gleamed the bronze about
the breast of Achilles as he ran.
And the old man groaned, and lifting his hands on
high he smote upon his head, and with a great cry he
called aloud, imploring his dear son; but Hektor stood
before the gates, insatiably eager to do battle with
Achilles. And the old man spake piteously to him,
stretching out his hands:-
'Hektor, my beloved son, bide not (I pray) yonder
man, alone, severed from the rest, lest thou meet thy
doom speedily, struck down by Achilles, relentless foe!
for he is mightier than thou by far. Would he were dear

be removed from my heart. Of many a noble son hath

my son, enter within the wall that thou mayest save the

man, any fate becometh him,-to be slain in war, to be
pierced with the sharp bronze, to lie unburied; yea,
all things are honourable to him in death, whatsoever
befalleth; but when dogs befoul the grey beard and the
hoar head of an old man slain, this for hapless mortals
is of all things the most pitiable '.'
77.] The old man ceased, and from his head plucked
the hoar hair; yet even so he prevailed not with
Hektor. Then on the other side his mother began to
wail, shedding tears, flinging back her vesture, while
with her hand she held up her breast:-
:-
'O my son, Hektor, reverence this sight, and pity
me too, if ever I held to thy lips a comforting breast;
bear this in mind, dear son; and from within the wall
keep this fearful man at bay, and stand not to encounter
him. Ruthless he is! for if he slay thee, no more
upon my bed shall I bewail thee, my child, offspring of
my flesh, nor shall thy rich-dowered wife; but very
every one will remember); but that house dogs should act in this
fashion to their own master seems almost inconceivable. Priam,
perhaps, in the intensity of his grief, may be allowed to exaggerate
the horrors he foresees; such exaggeration may be, as Leaf says,
'unlike the true Epic style,' but it is in singular agreement with what
we know of human nature. In any case, Homer is putting into
Priam's mouth a prophecy, not a description.
With 1. 64 cf. Ps. cxxxvii. 9, Isaiah xiii. 16. And are not the Adana
massacres fresh in men's minds?
1 Tyrtaeus has an almost precisely similar passage; but whether
Tyrtaeus borrowed from Homer, or Homer from Tyrtaeus, is purely
a matter of conjecture.

90.] Weeping thus they besought their loved son
with many a prayer; yet Hektor heeded not, but waited
for the coming of huge Achilles. As in the lone hills
a snake, fed on deadly herbs, awaiteth by his hole for
a man's approach; malignant rage hath entered him,
and, coiling about his lurking-place, he glareth terribly;
even so Hektor, his spirit unquenched, gave no ground,
his shining targe planted upon the jutting wall. In-
dignantly thus spake he to his proud heart :-
3
'Woe is me! if I enter within the city gates, Poulu-
damas will be foremost to fasten upon me a reproach,
who bade me draw the Trojans to the city under cover of
this murderous night, when godlike Achilles had arisen.
But I hearkened not; better had I so done. But now,
seeing I have destroyed this people in my folly, I fear
the men of Troy and the Trojan women with their
trailing robes, lest haply some one, less noble than I,
declare: "Hektor hath destroyed the people, because
he trusted in his own strength." Thus will men say;
but as for me, it were far better to slay Achilles, man to
man, and return in triumph, or else to perish gloriously
here before the city.

And if I lay down my bossy shield and heavy casque,
and leaning my spear against the wall go forth unarmed
to meet blameless Achilles, and promise him Helen,
and with her all the gear which Alexandros brought to
Troy in the hollow ships-source of the strife-for the
sons of Atreus to carry away; and if I promise yet other
gifts beside, even all the secret treasure of this city, for
division among the Achaians; and if, moreover, I should
wrest a solemn oath from the Trojans to hide naught
but to share all things equally 2... but wherefore doth
my heart thus commune with itself? I fear to go unto
Achilles, and sue for peace; surely he will neither pity
me, no, nor respect, but will slay me, defenceless as
a woman, whensoever I doff my armour. In no wise
now may one parley with him, from oak or rock³,
like maid and youth, as maid and youth hold parley
each with the other. Better to close in strife as soon
as may be; let us know to whom Olympian Zeus
granteth victory.'
131.] Thus, as he stood, he mused; and Achilles
drew near, terrible as Ares, war-lord of the waving
plume, brandishing over his right shoulder the dread
Pelian ash; and right and left glittered his mail
like the gleam of burning fire or of the sun when he
ariseth. And trembling fell upon Hektor when he

beheld him; nor did he dare bide where he was, but
left the gates behind, and fled in terror¹. And the son
of Peleus rushed upon him, trusting in his fleetness.
Like as a kestrel of the hills, swiftest of winged fowl,
swoopeth lightly after a trembling dove; she flieth
before him, but he, hard by, with stormy scream
followeth close behind, eager to clutch the prey: even
so in hot haste flew Achilles straight on; while Hektor
shrank away under the walls of Troy, on nimble feet.
Past a watch-tower and a wind-beaten fig-tree they rushed,
ever away from the wall, along the wagon-track, till
they reached the fair-flowing springs; for there the
double springs of eddying Skamandros well up²; and
the one floweth with warm water, and all about there
riseth from it a steam, as from a burning fire; and the
other, even in summer time, floweth cold as hail or
frozen snow or ice borne from the water. Over
against the springs are broad washing-troughs of stone,
fair-wrought, where the dames and fair daughters of
Troy were wont to wash their glossy garments afore-
time, in days of peace, or ever the Achaians came.
Past these they ran with fiery speed, Hektor fleeing,
Achilles pursuing after; for they strove not for ox or
shield, the prizes in a foot-race; the life of horse-taming

2 According to the authorities, this is in the nature of a fancy
picture; so the geography is not to be pressed too closely. Yet the
picture, however fanciful in its details, preserves a fairly accurate
tradition; the Skamandros (the modern Menderé), which is the chief
river of the Troad, does rise from two springs, one of which is
warm-varying between 60 and 70 Fahrenheit. But then they are
on Mt. Ida; and this is thirty miles off. The Kaπvós, which Homer
depicts as issuing from this spring, might very possibly be seen in
winter.

Hektor was the stake for which they were a-foot¹. As
when firm-hooved steeds, matched in a race, gallop
swiftly round the goal; and therewithal a great prize is
set, tripod or damsel, in honour of some dead hero2:
so the two with rapid feet thrice circuited the city of
Priam; and all the gods looked on ³.
167.] And the father of gods and men spake among
them on this wise :-
4
'Alack, with mine eyes I behold a man I love chased
round and round the city wall; and my heart grieveth for
Hektor, who oft hath burned plenteous fat thighs of
bullocks upon mine altar, now on the summits of many-
folded Ida, now again on the city's heights; but this
hour godlike Achilles pursueth him with rapid feet
around the citadel of Priam. But come, ye gods, con-
sider well, and give me your counsel whether we save
him alive from death, or slay him, brave as he is,
beneath the hand of Achilles, son of Peleus.'
177.] And the goddess, bright-eyed Athena, replied:-
'O Father, lord of the flashing levin, dwelling in dark
cloud, what word hast thou spoken? art thou minded
to save from ill-sounding death a mortal man, doomed

we all, the rest of the gods, shall praise thee not.'
Then did cloud-gathering Zeus make answer :—
'Be of good comfort, Tritogeneia, dear child; I speak
no wise in grim earnest, but verily my purpose is to be
kind. Do as thou listest, nor fail.'
With such words urged he on Athena, that was eager
aforetime; and, with a flash, she sped from the heights
of Olumpos.
188.] Meantime swift Achilles pressed upon Hektor,
keeping him ever before him. As when among the hills
a dog pursueth a fawn through copse and glen, starting
it from its lair; though it hide, cowering, beneath some
thicket, still he runneth staunchly, close upon the track,
until he find it¹: so Hektor could not hide from swift-
footed Achilles. But often as he rushed eagerly for the
Dardan gates, to get him beneath the well-built towers,
if peradventure the Trojans might shield him with their
bolts, so often would Achilles forestall him and turn
him aside toward the plain, but himself sweep ever

pursuing Turnus) :-
'Nor less Aeneas, tho' his halting knees
Ofttimes impede his course, pursueth still,
Step after painful step, the flying foe.
As when a hound new-lighted on a stag
Hemmed by a stream, or foiled by crimson scares,
With clamorous tongue pursueth; lo, the stag,
By toils affrighted or the lofty bank,
Flieth, first here then there, a thousand ways;
Yet ever on his ear hangs open-mouthed
That eager hound; and now he all but holds,
Now snaps as though he held, but baffled bites
The idle air.'

forward upon the city side'. And, as in a dream, the
dreamer cannot move in pursuit of the flying foe; so
could not Achilles overtake Hektor, nor Hektor elude
Achilles 2. How could Hektor have escaped death's
doom³, had not Apollo for the last time drawn nigh to
meet him, and given him new strength and made swift
his limbs?
Then divine Achilles with his head signed unto the rest*,
and suffered them not to launch bitter shafts at Hektor,
lest another should win renown by the cast, and he
come second. But when at length they were come the
fourth time to the springs, then did the almighty Father
hang his golden scales aloft, and set therein twin fates

to pursue'); it is awkward, at best, and adds nothing to the picture.
Virgil finely renders the passage, Aen. xii. 908-12 :—
'And as in dreams when languorous sleep hath sealed
The eyes by night, with vain desire we seem
To ply new powers; amid our zeal we sink
Palsied; the tongue grows faint; the wonted strength
Fails, and no voice is heard, nor any word:
So the dread goddess still denied success
To Turnus, spite of all his valiant strife.'

also. In ancient Egyptian religion, Thoth ('Lord of the Scales')
weighed the souls of the dead in the underworld. To the early Indian
imagination, the Ordeal of the Balance was part of the outlook into
the world beyond; while in primitive Persian teaching, Rashnu, the
angel of justice, presided, in the presence of Mithra. over the weighing

of Death, the destroyer,—the one fate of Achilles, the
other of horse-taming Hektor; these scales he took by
the midst, and held them; and behold, the fateful day
of Hektor inclined, and went down to the grave; and
Phoibos Apollo left him.
And blue-eyed Athena came near unto the son of
Peleus, and, standing at his side, spake winged words :-
'Now at last, methinks, O glorious Achilles, beloved
of Zeus, we twain shall bring victory for the Achaians
by their ships, by the slaying of Hektor, insatiate of
battle! No longer may he escape us, not even if far-
darting Apollo should suffer many things, grovelling low
before our father, aegis-bearing Zeus'. Now therefore
halt thou, and take breathing; but I shall go and
persuade him to meet thee face to face in battle.'
223.] Thus spake Athena; and Achilles hearkened,
and was glad; and he stood, halting upon his bronze-
tipt staff. Then the goddess departed from him, but
lighted upon godlike Hektor; and she made herself like
unto Deiphobos in frame and tireless voice. And she
stood beside him, and spake winged words:-
'My brother, but now swift Achilles bested thee
sore, chasing thee round about the city of Priam on
rapid feet; go to, let us make a stand, and biding here
resist him.'
of spirits at the 'bridge of destiny'. And, to come to later times, over
the chancel-arch at Southleigh (near Oxford) there is a mediaeval fresco
of the Last Judgement and the Resurrection, depicting Michael the
archangel holding a pair of scales; in one scale is a human soul, in the
other a demon-figure trying to weight the scale towards the abyss.-

Then answered her great Hektor of the glancing
helm :-
'Deïphobos, aforetime thou wert dearest to me of all
my brothers, sons of Hekabe and Priam; and now,
methinks', I shall honour thee yet the more, for that,
when thou didst see me with thine eyes, thou wert bold
to issue from the city for my sake, while the rest abide
within.'
And the goddess, blue-eyed Athena, replied:-
'Brother, our father and queenly mother, and our
comrades also, did earnestly beseech me, clasping my
knees, to tarry there; so much they all stand in awe of
him. But my heart within me was worn with bitter
sorrow. Now, therefore, gird we us straightway for
battle; let us in no wise spare our lances, that we may
know whether Achilles will slay us and carry off the
bloody spoil to the hollow ships, or himself be vanquished
by thy spear.'
247] So did Athena lure him with guile that
matched her words. And it came to pass,
when they
were come nigh to each other, that mighty Hektor of
the glancing helm spoke first :-
'Son of Peleus, no more shall I quail before thee, as
heretofore. Thrice round Priam's city fled I, nor ever
dared to bide thy coming; but now my spirit prompteth
me to stand and face thee; fain would I slay or be slain.

covenant. I will not do thee shameful outrage, if Zeus
grant me to overcome thee, and I take away thy life;
nay rather, when I have stript thee of thy fair armour,
Achilles, I will render thy corpse to the Achaians; so
also do thou.'
260.] With fierce glance swift-footed Achilles an-
swered him :—
'Accursed' Hektor, prate to me not of covenants!
As between lions and mankind no trusty oaths hold,
and wolves and lambs agree not together but meditate
evil against one another continually, so cannot I and
thou love each other, nor shall there be pact betwixt us
till one of us with his blood sate Ares, that warrior with
the bull-targe. Mind thee of all thy prowess; now quit
thee like a good spearman and a valiant warrior. Truly,
for thee, escape there is none; straightway will Pallas
Athena lay thee low by spear of mine; now shalt
thou in one lump pay back all the sorrows of my
comrades, slain with thy stormy spear.'
273.] With these words he balanced his long-
shadowing spear, then launched it; but glorious Hektor
marked its coming, and swerved aside; for he crouched
low, so that the bronze spear flew over him and was
rooted in earth; and Pallas Athena plucked it up, and
gave it back to Achilles, all unobserved by Hektor,
shepherd of the folk. Then spake Hektor to the
blameless son of Peleus:-
I will call on the name of the Lord; and the god that answereth by
fire, let him be God.'

word, to the end that I should tremble before thee, forget-
ful of my prowess and might. Nay, if heaven alloweth,

now, on thy part, avoid my spear; would that thou
mightest receive it deep within thy flesh! so, by thy
death, would war prove lighter to the Trojans, for thou

279.] He spake; then balancing his long-shadowing
spear, launched it full at Achilles, and smote him midmost
his shield, nor missed his aim; but the spear glanced
away far from the shield. Then was Hektor wroth,
because that swift weapon had fallen idle from his hand;
downcast he stood, for he carried no second ashen spear².
With a loud voice he called upon Deiphobos of the white
shield, and asked him for a long javelin; but he was far
away. Then Hektor understood all, and cried aloud³:—
'Woe is me! in very surety the gods have summoned
me to my death. For I deemed that valiant Deïphobos
was nigh at hand; but he is within the city, and Athena
hath deceived me.

the part of the Homeric gods is where Athena, in the crisis of
Hektor's fate, takes her stand by the side of the hero, in the guise of
his brother, in order to lure him by the hope of fraternal succour to
destruction, and vanishes as soon as he is at the mercy of his foe.
We make a grave mistake if we regard these and similar delineations
of the divine nature in the Homeric poems as having only a poetic or
dramatic value. It is part of the tragedy of Homeric life that they
were believed to be true' (Adam, Religious Teachers of Greece, p. 40).

doughty, which hung extended at his side; then, gathering
himself together, on he swooped like a soaring eagle
which speedeth plainward through darkling clouds, to
seize a weak lamb or timid hare: so, brandishing his
keen blade, Hektor swooped on. And Achilles rushed
upon him, his heart filled with fury; before his breast he
held the fair shield, richly wrought, to cover him, and
the crest of his shining helm quivered; and the goodly
hairs thereof did shake. Bright as Hesper³ that gleameth

towards Hector. This is the more peculiarly Homeric use of direct
speech, when it serves to bring a motive or a situation into clear
relief. Hence a man's thoughts are often given as words spoken by
him to his own soul, as Hector's thoughts are when Achilles is draw-

and their wives may yield me the meed of fire.'
344.] But, with a fierce scowl, swift-footed Achilles
spake :-
'Prate not to me, thou dog, of knees and parents.
Would that my fierce anger might suffer me myself to
hew thy flesh from off thee and eat it raw, for all thou
hast done unto me! There is none that shall keep the
dogs from thee. No, not if ten times, aye twenty times,
men should bring countless ransoms, and weigh them out,
and promise yet others beside; no, not if Priam, son of
Dardanos, should bid his retainers pay thy weight in
gold; even so shall not thy queenly mother set thee on
thy bed and make lamentation for him she bare; but dogs
and birds shall utterly consume thee.'
355.] Then, in the throes of death, .spake Hektor of
the glancing plume :-
'Verily, I know thee well, and forbode my doom; not
mine to persuade thee, for the heart within thee is as
iron. Yet bethink thee, lest I prove unto thee a curse
of the gods', in that day when Paris and Phoibos
Apollo shall slay thee, for all thy might, at the Skaian
gates 2.
But when he had ended speaking, death closed in upon
him; and from his limbs the soul sped to Hades, bewail-

thee the anger of the gods', as Butcher and Lang render). The shade
of Hektor will haunt his murderer for the profanity threatened. See

Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion, esp. pp. 449 sqq.

thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.'

ing its destiny, bereft of manhood and of youth'. Then
spake godlike Achilles to the dead :-
'Lie thou, dead: but I shall welcome my fate when-
soever Zeus and the other deathless gods will its
accomplishment.'
367.] He spake, and drew the bronze spear from the
corpse, and laid it aside; then from the shoulders he
stripped the blood-stained harness; and all the sons
of the Achaians ran marvelling at Hektor's stature and
noble mien; and none came nigh that did not deal him
a stab². And thus and thus would a man speak, glancing
at his neighbour :-
'Ho, verily Hektor is softer to touch than when he
was burning our ships with blazing fire.'
Thus would they speak, and come near and stab the
dead. And when swift-footed divine Achilles had
finished despoiling him, he stood among the Achaians
and uttered winged words :-
'My friends, leaders and chieftains of the Argives,
seeing that the gods have vouchsafed unto me to slay
yonder man who wrought more evil than all the rest,
These words are repeated from xvi. 855-7 (the scene of Patroklos'
death). For lines 365-6 see xviii. 115-16, and Virg. Aen. x. 743 :—
'Nunc morere! ast de me divum pater atque hominum rex
Viderit.'
2 If the body be mutilated, the ghost is, according to primitive
nations, rendered harmless. Frazer has collected several examples,
from modern savage custom, of the practice of mutilating a man in
order to disable his ghost, remarking that such practices, hideous as
they seem to us, may well spring, not from the blind fury of hatred
but from a cool calculation of the best mode of protecting the slayers
against the very natural resentment of the ghosts (Golden Bough³,
'Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild,' ii. 271 sq.).

come let us make assault in arms upon the city', that we
may discover further the purpose of the Trojans, whether
they will leave the citadel, now Hektor is fallen; or
whether they purpose to bide their ground, though he be
Yet wherefore doth my heart reason thus?
Patroklos still lieth by the ships, a corpse, unwept,
unburied; and him I shall not forget, while I remain
alive and my limbs have power to move. Nay, even if
in the grave men forget their dead, yet will I, even there,
remember my loved comrade. Now therefore, ye sons
of Achaia, let us sing a thanksgiving, and return to the
hollow ships, bringing this man with us; great renown
is ours; we have slain godlike Hektor³, whom the Trojans
in their city worshipped as a god.'
395.] He spake, and bethought him of a deed of
shame for godlike Hektor. He pierced both sinews of
his feet behind, from heel to ankle, and fastened thereto
thongs of bull's-hide, and bound him to his chariot,
while his head he suffered to trail upon the earth'.
1 Leaf, however, understands this to mean 'let us make a recon-
naissance in force.'
2 To abandon the citadel was to abandon the city.
3 These lines are thus rendered by Seneca :-
'Ite agite, o Danai, magnum paeana canentes;
Ite triumphantes: belli mora concidit Hector.'
4 According to the older legend, Hektor was killed by being dragged
at the chariot, alive, and it was this form of the story that was
followed by Sophocles in the Ajax (1030) :—
Εκτωρ μὲν ᾧ δὴ τοῦδ᾽ ἐδωρήθη πάρα
ζωστῆρι πρισθεὶς ἱππικῶν ἐξ ἀντύγων
ἐκνάπτετ᾽ αἰέν, ἔστ᾽ ἀπέψυξεν βίον.
'With the very girdle given him by Aias [cf. Il. vii. 303 sqq.]
Hektor was firmly bound to the chariot-rail, and mangled till he yielded
up his life.'
Plato (Republic 391 B) thought that, even in its modified form, the

Then, mounting the chariot, he gathered up the famous
armour, and lashed his steeds, who, nothing loth, flew
forward. And his dragging lifted a cloud of dust; and
his dusky locks were scattered abroad, and all his head,
once so beautiful, was laid in the dust. Now had Zeus
granted unto his enemies to do him despite in his own
fatherland.
405.] Thus was Hektor's head marred all with dust;
and his mother tore her hair, and cast afar her glistering
kerchief, and wailed with an exceeding bitter wailing as
she beheld her son. And his loved father groaned
piteously, and all around the people filled the city with
wailing and lamentation. Behold, it was as if all
beetling¹ Troy were smouldering, from height to depth,
in the flame. Hardly could the people restrain the old
man, in his frenzy, from issuing forth wildly from the
Dardan gates. And he rolled himself in the filth² and
besought all men, calling upon each by name :—
'Hold, my friends, and, spite your care for me, suffer
me to go forth alone from the city to the Achaian ships.
I will supplicate this dreadful man, this doer of violence;
peradventure he will reverence my grey hairs ³, and have

related of Alexander the Great, who dragged a conquered prince alive
at his chariot wheels. For similar acts of barbarity see Mayor's

'ashes' probably signifies the dungheap outside the gate of the city:

compassion upon my years. He, too, hath a father,
even such an one as I,-Peleus, who begat him and
reared him to be a pest unto the Trojans. Upon me,
beyond all others, hath he brought sorrow, so many
sons of mine, in the flower of their age, hath he slain.
Though sore harassed, I mourn not for them all as
I mourn for one, sharp sorrow for whom will bring me
down to the grave¹,-even Hektor. O that he had
died in my arms! Then might we,-his hapless mother
who bore him, and I myself, his father,—have had our
fill of tears and grief.'
429.] Thus he spake, weeping, and the townsmen
groaned aloud. Then amid her Trojan dames Hekabe
brake forth into vehement lamentation :-
'O, my child, heart-stricken am I. How can I live
my life, in my sore distress, bereft of thee? Night and
day thou wert wont to be my pride throughout the city,
a tower of strength unto the men and women of Troy,
who used to welcome thee as a god. In sooth, while
thou livedst, thou wert a great glory to them; but now
have death and fate overtaken thee.'
2
Thus spake she through her tears; but Hektor's
wife knew not as yet what had befallen; for no sure
messenger had arrived to bear her tidings that her
husband still remained outside the gates; but she, in
an inner chamber within the lofty palace, was weaving
a double cloak, all purple, whereon were embroidered
gay flowers of divers colours. She had bidden her
perchance feel shame before his equals.' He might feel disgraced
among young men if he rejected the prayer of an aged suppliant.

a huge tripod, that Hektor, returned from battle, might
be refreshed with warm baths,-poor fool! she knew
not that, far from any bath, blue-eyed Athena had laid
Hektor low by the hands of Achilles. And she heard
wailing and lamentation from the rampart¹; and her
limbs shook, and the shuttle fell from her hand to the
ground. Then spake she to her fair-tressed hand-
maids :-
450.] 'Come, two of you follow me; I would see
what hath been done. My honoured mother's' voice
have I heard, and my heart leapeth to my mouth, and
my limbs beneath are frozen; surely some mischief
hath befallen the sons of Priam. Be that word far from
me! yet do I fear lest godlike Achilles have cut off
Hektor, left alone, from the city and driven him plain-
ward, and quenched that fatal pride which possessed
him; for never would he tarry amid a throng, but rush
out far to vaward, yielding to no man in the might
that was his.'
460.] With such words she rushed from the house,
like a mad woman, with beating heart; and with her
went the handmaids. And when she was come to the
rampart, where the multitude was gathered, she stood
on the wall, and gazed abroad; then saw him-her
Hektor-being dragged before the city; for the swift
unknown in antiquity. In the famous poem of Sappho, Aphrodite is
described as Tоikiλółрov' ('goddess of the spangled flowers,' though
many edd. prefer to understand this epithet as meaning 'goddess of
the fair-carven throne').

when her breath came again, and her spirit was revived
within her, she lifted up her voice and sobbed out
among the Trojan dames :—

Thebes beneath woody Plakos, in the house of Eëtion,

a kerchief secured by (3) a braid (πλектǹv åvadéoµnv); (4) a large
linen veil (ρýdeμvov) falling over the shoulders and back. Helbig,
however, conjectures that the Kekpúpaλos was a sort of high stiff cap

escape the Achaians' tearful war, ever shall toil and
sorrow be his lot hereafter; for others will take away
his heritage¹. The day of orphanhood cutteth off
a child from his fellows; his head is utterly bowed down,
his cheeks are dewed with tears, and in his hour of need
he seeketh after his father's friends, plucking one by the
mantle, another by the gown 2; and one of them, if they
take compassion, just reacheth him a cup, wetting his
lips, but not his throat. And some lad, his parents both
alive', will thrust him roughly from the feast, with blows
and bitter reproaches: 'Away! thy sire feasteth not with
us.' Then returneth the child, all tears, to his widowed
mother, he, Astuanax, who aforetime at his father's knee
was wont to eat marrow and fatness only; who, when
sleep overtook him and his childish cares were lulled,
would sleep in his bed, in his nurse's arms, wrapt in soft
raiment, his heart full fed with goodly cheer. But now
must he suffer sore, bereft of his loved father,―he,

in Greece) contrasts, with the cruelty shown to children in the Homeric
world, the kindliness shown by Irish peasants who will share their
scant fare with the orphan as if he were one of their own children. It
was sternly forbidden by the Mosaic code to afflict the fatherless child

Achilles and his followers pay honour to the body of Patroklos.
After the funeral-feast, the ghost of Patroklos appears to Achilles, as
he sleeps by the sea-shore, to crave burial for his corpse. This is
burned on a huge pyre, the next morning, with slaying of many
victims, including twelve Trojan captives.
Next follow the Funeral Games, which are described at length.
SCENE: On the sea-shore.
Thus throughout the city did the Trojans make
lamentation; and when the Achaians were come to the
1 There was a tradition in antiquity that the great games of Greece
had their origin in funeral celebrations. That tradition is confirmed
by Greek practice; for, in historical times, games were instituted to do
honour to many famous men. Examples may be found in the cases of
Miltiades, Leonidas (the hero of Thermopylae), Brasidas, Timoleon
the saviour of Syracuse, and others. The Greeks also instituted
games in honour of men who had perished on the battlefield; and
their practice has been followed elsewhere both in ancient and
modern times. It is said that the great Irish Fairs originated in
funeral games; and in Circassia the anniversary of a great warrior's
death is still celebrated by various kinds of races, horse and foot.-
Cf. Frazer, Golden Bough³ ( The Dying God,' pp. 91 sqq.).
The ancient title of this book is ἆθλα ἐπὶ Πατρόκλῷ, ‘The Games in
honour of Patroklos.' But in point of fact it consists of two parts:
(A) the FUNERAL, I-256; (B) the GAMES, 275-end. These Games are
eight in number; (1) Chariot race, 257-652; (2) Boxing match,
653-99; (3) Wrestling match, 700-39; (4) Foot-race, 740-97 ;
(5) Single combat, 798-825; (6) Putting the weight, 826-49;
(7) Archery, 850-83; (8) Throwing the spear, 884-97. See J.C. Stobart,

ships and the Hellespont, they dispersed, each man to
his own ship. But the Murmidons Achilles suffered not
to disperse, but spake on this wise among his warlike
friends :-
1
'Ye Murmidons, whose horses are swift, my trusty
comrades, let us not loose our firm-hooved steeds ¹ from
under the chariots, but draw near, men and chariots
together, and weep over Patroklos; for such is the
honour due unto the dead. And when we have taken
our fill of bitter sorrow, we will all loosen our steeds and
share our food in this place.'
12.] Thus he spake, and they all raised the dirge
together; and Achilles led the strain. Thrice around
the dead man they drave their fair-maned horses, weeping
as they went; and Thetis awakened in their hearts
a desire for sorrow. The sands were wet 2, wet too the
harness of the warriors, with tears; so mighty was the
deviser of rout whom they mourned. Then in their
midst did the son of Peleus begin a passionate lament,
with his murderous hands laid upon his friend's
bosom ³ 3:-

and interest as poetry. The descriptions in it are full of life and
picturesqueness; nor can the reader fail to notice the pathos that runs
through the whole of the funeral portion.

Even now I am fulfilling all I promised aforetime;
Hektor I have dragged hither for dogs to devour raw,
and twelve noble sons of the Trojans will I slaughter
before the pyre 2, in vengeance for thy death.'

He spake, and foully did he misuse godlike Hektor,
stretching him prone upon the dust by the bier of
Patroklos. And his followers cast off each man his
shining bronze mail, and unyoked their high-neighing
steeds, and sat down beside the ship of the swift-footed
son of Aiakos, a countless host; while Achilles spread
before them a bounteous funeral-feast. Many sleek oxen
stretched themselves in death, the knife within them;
many a sheep, and bleating goat; and many white-tusked
boars, rich in fat, were spread out to roast over the
flame of Hephaistos; and all about the dead man flowed
blood, poured forth from goblets".'

χαῖρε καὶ εἶν 'Αΐδεω δώμασι, Καλλίμαχε.
The custom of human sacrifice was familiar to the Greeks, as to
most ancient peoples, and it survived to historic times. Save for this
one instance, it is conspicuously absent from the picture of civilization
displayed in Homer.-Cf. Frazer, Golden Bough³ ('The Dying God,'
chap. vi); McCulloch, Childhood of Fiction, pp. 424 sqq.; R. C.
Thompson, Semitic Magic, pp. 221 sq.; Farnell, Greece and Babylon,

5 Blood is given by the mourners to the shades of the dead to
strengthen them. Palgrave tells us that, in the opinion of the Arabs,
the souls of the dead actually demand sacrifices at their tombs, and
the blood thus shed revivifies and sustains them. In ancient Egypt
funerary offerings, with a like end in view, were customary: Erman,
Life in Ancient Egypt, pp. 310, 323 (E.T.). In Greece the burial was
usually followed by the funeral feast (Tepideπvov); and a like ordi-
nance prevailed among the Romans: see Becker's Gallus for references.

the swift-footed son of Peleus, to the tent of godlike
Agamemnon, scarcely persuading him, so wroth was he
for his friend. But when at last they were come to
Agamemnon's tent, they commanded straightway the
clear-voiced heralds to stand a great tripod over the fire,
if haply they might persuade the son of Peleus to wash
away his bloody stains. But he refused stoutly, and
swore moreover an oath :-
'Nay, by Zeus, highest and mightiest of all gods, no
water may come anigh this head of mine, or ever I have
laid Patroklos on the pyre, and over him heaped
a barrow, and shorn my hair; for never more will sorrow
like this pierce my heart, while I sojourn among the
living. Howbeit let us, for the time, take part in the
loathed feast; and do thou at early dawn, Agamemnon,
king of men, bid the men bring wood and make ready
whatsoever the dead should fitly have when he journeyeth
to the mirky shadows beneath, that the unwearying fire
may the swifter consume him away from before our eyes,
and the people turn them to their tasks.'
54.] Thus he spake, and they heard him gladly and
obeyed. With eager haste they severally made ready
the feast, and did eat, and their souls no wise lacked
abundant cheer. But when they had satisfied their lust
for meat and drink, they went each man to his tent, to

best to hinder these somewhat exuberant 'memoriae martyrum;'

resounding sea, lay, groaning deeply, amid his Murmi-

washed against the beach. Then slumber shed sweetly

1 For the Homeric view of existence after death, cf. Taylor, Ancient
Ideals, i. 161 sqq.-The belief that the soul has some sort of persistence
after death, that the man's ghost has power for at least a time after
dissolution, was shared by the Greeks with many primitive races.
But why should the denizens of Hades make the admission of
a newly-sped soul to their ranks conditional upon the burial of the
body? Are we to take the theory that (under certain conditions) the
soul might return to reanimate the dead body and raise it again
as a revenant? And was this theory Homer's, or did he utilize
a merely popular conception? See Lawson, Modern Greek Folk-lore
and Ancient Greek Religion, pp. 431, 517.

Hindu belief in the restless state of the soul after death until the

my meed of fire. Nay, never more shall we sit, at least
in life, apart from our dear comrades, taking counsel
together; but upon me hateful doom¹ hath gaped,-
doom which was my portion even at birth. Aye and to
thee thyself also, Achilles, thou peer of the gods, it is
fated to perish beneath the wall of the wealthy Trojans.
Another thing I will tell thee, and will straitly charge
thee, if peradventure thou wilt hearken: lay not my
bones apart from thine, Achilles, but side by side; for we
were brought up together in thy house, when Menoitios
brought me, a child, from Opöeis to thy father's house
because of woful bloodshed on the day when I slew the
son of Amphidamas, myself a child, unwittingly, but in
wrath over our games. Then did Peleus, the knight,
take me into his home and rear me kindly and name
me thy squire. So let one urn also hide the bones of
us both ".'

said:-
'Why, dearest and best-beloved, hast thou come
hither to lay upon me these thy several behests? Of
a truth I will accomplish all, and bow to thy command.
But stand nearer, I pray; for a little space let us cast
our arms about each other, and take our fill of dire
sorrow.'

With these words he stretched forth his hands to
clasp him, but could not; for, like a smoke ¹, the spirit
vanished earthward with a wailing cry'. Amazed,
Achilles sprang up, and smote his hands together ³, and

3 In the portrayal of human passion Homer is strong and terrible,
yet human. There is nothing of the portentous violence which some-
times in the Elizabethan drama seems almost to remove the stage
from the reason of dominion; nor are we troubled with that languor
and self-consciousness which are mingled so often with the melancholy
of latter-day poets. The heroes of Hellenic story cry out in their
pain, but we feel in their anguish the expression of a nature not too
self-conscious; even in the disorder of the emotions there is some-
thing of health which seems a latent antidote to bitterness (Myers,
in Hellenica 2, pp. 10, 11). Cf. Ruskin, Modern Painters, vol. v, part
ix, chap. ii, §§ 18-20).
4 Cf. Clodd, Myths and Dreams, § ix. The underworld was, to the
Greek, as to the Hebrews, a place of quiet sadness :—
It is a land of shadows; yea, the land
Itself is but a shadow, and the race
That dwell therein are voices, forms of forms.'
More than one part of the man survived death. This reminds us
of the Egyptian belief in the ba (or soul), the khu (or mind), the ka (or
'double'), the khabit (or shade). See Weidemann, The Realms of the
Egyptian Dead (pp. 58-60). The ka (like the Babylonian ki) corre-
sponds to the Latin genius, and is akin to the Persian fravashi. Similar
ideas are found among modern tribes; thus, the Algonquins believe in

all)¹. For all night long the soul of poor Patroklos stood
beside me, crying and making lamentation, and bade
me do his will; it was the perfect image of himself.'
So he spake, and in the hearts of them all roused
desire for lamentation; and while they yet were
mourning, about the pitiful corpse appeared rosy-fingered
dawn2.
110.] Then did King Agamemnon send forth from
the tents all about men and mules to bring fuel; and
there kept watch upon them a valiant man, Meriones,
squire of brave Idomeneus. So the men departed, with
felling axes in their hands, and twisted cords; before
them went the mules; uphill and downhill, athwart and
across, came they³. And when they reached the lower
slopes of many-fountained Ida, straightway they fell
to hacking the tall oaks with long-edged axes, in haste;
down crashed the trees with loud noise. These next
they clave, harnessing them to the mules, which tare up
the earth with their feet, as they made eagerly for the plain
through the dense brakes. The woodmen all bare logs;
for such was the commandment of Meriones, henchman
a duality of soul, the Dakotas and Khonds in four souls. In the Epistle
to the Hebrews (iv. 12) the dichotomy of yuxά and πveûμa is very
clearly marked.
1 The shades have no opéves, no intelligence. They have lost their
hold on the realities of the world above. The word opéves is prop.
midriff, the Greeks finding it difficult to conceive of mind apart from
its supposed physical basis. Cf. Adam, Religious Teachers of Greece,
PP. 55-7.
2 'There is,' says Symonds (The Greek Poets, i. 93), 'nothing more
thrilling in its pathos throughout the whole range of poetry than this
scene, in which the iron-hearted conqueror of Hektor holds ineffectual
communing in dreams with his dear, lost, never-to-be-forgotten
friend.'

of brave Idomeneus. Then cast they them upon the
shore, in due order, at the place where Achilles was
minded to rear a huge barrow for Patroklos and for
himself.
127.] Now when they had laid, side by side, the
measureless heap, they sat them down there and
waited, a goodly multitude. And Achilles bade forth-
right his warlike Murmidons to don their coats of mail,
and yoke each man the horses beneath the chariots.
And they arose and donned their harness, and fighting-
men and drivers mounted their cars. In front were the
horsemen, and after them in their thousands followed
the footmen; and in the midst thereof his comrades
bare Patroklos. And they apparelled the corpse all
over with their locks¹ which they had shorn off and cast
thereon; and, behind, godlike Achilles, sore grieving,
held the head of Patroklos, for he was ushering his
blameless comrade to the grave.
138.] And when they had come to the place which
Achilles had appointed unto them, they set the corpse
down, and swiftly heaped up plenteous wood. Then
did swift-footed godlike Achilles devise yet another
thing he stood apart from the pyre and cut away his
yellow hair, which he had been cherishing in full

growth for the river-god Spercheios; and sorrowfully
he spake, with eyes turned toward the wine-dark
sea¹:-
'Spercheios, in vain did mine old father Peleus vow,
unto thee, that on my safe return to my dear land,
I would cut off my locks in thine honour and offer an holy
hecatomb, and shed into thy springs the blood of rams
without blemish, hard by the spot where thy hallowed
precinct is, and sweet-smelling altar. So he vowed;
but thou accomplishedst not his purpose. Now there-
fore, seeing I return no more to my dear fatherland,
suffer me to yield this hair unto Patroklos, for him
to take.'
152.] So saying, he laid the locks in the hands of his
dear comrade, and woke within each man a longing for
lamentation. And now had the sun's light gone down
to the Hebrews under the Mosaic code: see Driver on Deut. xiv. 1,
'Ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your
eyes for the dead'; Jeremiah xvi. 6. Cf. Frazer, Golden Boughs
('Taboo, or the Perils of the Soul,' p. 261). In the British Museum
will be found a votive relief representing two plaits of hair dedicated
to Poseidon, as the inscription thereon shows. It may be remembered
that Alexander the Great dedicated his hair at the tomb of Achilles.

3 Plato, Repub. 391 B, professed to disbelieve that Achilles would
have defrauded thus a god of a promised gift. It must not be forgotten,
however, that the 'vow' was conditional on Achilles' safe return
(VOOTHσavтa); and this, he knew, was hopeless. For exx. of 'im-
precatory' vows in the O.T. cf. Gen. xxviii. 20, 'And Jacob vowed a
vow, saying, If God will be with me... so that I come again to my
father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God; and this stone,
which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house'; and 2 Sam.
xv. 7, 8; Numb. xxi. 2. The transaction seems to us even more
commercial than the familiar motive of sacrifice, do ut des; it may be
formulated dabo si dederis (Encycl. Biblica, vol. iv, col. 5253).

upon their dole, but that Achilles stood beside Agamem-
non, and spake on this wise :-
'Son of Atreus,-for to thy words most of all will the
people of Achaia hearken,-they may, for me, take their
fill of grief¹; but now scatter them from the burning and
bid them make ready the meal; we, the dead man's nearest
and dearest, will look to all these things. But let the
chieftains tarry with us.'
And it was so when Agamemnon, king of men, heard
this, that straightway he scattered the people to the
well-poised ships; but the mourners remained there
and heaped wood, and made a pyre an hundred feet
either way, and on the top they set the corpse, sorrow-
ing. And many goodly sheep, and shambling kine with
crooked horns, they flayed before the pyre and made
ready; and high-hearted Achilles took their fat³, and
wrapped the dead man therein from head to foot, and
piled the flayed carcasses round about. And he placed
pitchers of honey and of oil, leaning them against the
bier; next four steeds with arching necks he cast upon
the pyre, groaning deeply the while. Nine dogs had
Patroklos, that fed at his table; two he slaughtered
1 So Leaf renders. But it is possible to render: 'there is such
a thing as having a surfeit of grief.'
2 Vast as this pyre was, it was small in comparison with that raised
to the Scythian war-god, as described by Herodotus iv. 62. Indeed,
the dimensions there given seem incredible.

6 The custom of offering horses to the dead is one of great antiquity:
see note on xxi. 131. The ghosts of the slain horses and dogs would
be valuable to the ghost of their dead owner in the underworld.
There is nothing 'piacular' in the offering either of horses or dogs;
and the slaughter of the Trojan youths was, doubtless, rather an act of

and cast upon the pyre, together with twelve noble sons
of the high-hearted Trojans, whom he slew with the
bronze; for the thought of his heart was vengeance.
And into the heap he sent the relentless might of fire,
to feed thereon; and, after that, he cried aloud, and
called upon his beloved comrade by name:—
'All hail, Patroklos, even in the house of Hades; all
things are now accomplished, even as I promised.
There be twelve noble sons of the high-hearted Trojans
whom the fire devoureth together with thee; but
Hektor I shall in no wise give to the flames, but for
dogs to eat.'
184.] Such his threat; but no dogs busied them-
selves upon Hektor; for day and night Aphrodite,
daughter of Zeus, kept them at bay, and anointed him with
rose-sweet oil ambrosial, to the end that Achilles might
not graze him in the dragging. Phoibos Apollo, too,
brought down from heaven to earth a dark cloud, and
shrouded all the place where the body lay, lest the sun's
strength should shrivel the flesh round about on sinews
and limbs, ere his burial.
Howbeit the pyre of Patroklos was slow to burn.
Then did swift-footed divine Achilles bethink him of yet
another device: apart he stood, and prayed unto the
two winds, Boreas and Zephuros, and vowed fair
victims; and pouring libations from a golden cup he
besought their presence, that with all speed the corpses
might be consumed with fire, and the wood be quickened
for the burning. And lo, Iris the swift, hearkening to
his prayers, sped on errand to the winds. Now it was
so that they were holding reyel all together in the
revenge than a sacrifice proper (cf. sup. 23), though mixed motives
probably co-operated.

palace of stormy Zephuros, when Iris hasted thither
and stood on the stony threshold. And soon as they
beheld her, they leaped up, and called her, each one,
to side beside him; but she would not, and thus
accosted them :-
'No seat for me! for I take my way to the streams
of Okeanos, to the Aithiopians' land, where men offer
hecatombs to the Immortals, that I, too, may share in
the holy things. But Achilles prayeth Boreas and
blustering Zephuros to come, and voweth fair victims,
that so ye may kindle the pyre whereon lieth Patroklos,
whom all the Achaians are mourning.'
212.] So spake she, and took her way; and the
winds arose with vehement noise, driving the clouds
before them. Speedily they came to the deep, and
blew thereon', and the wave sprang up beneath their
shrill breath; to fertile Troy came they, then fell upon
the pyre, and lo, there was a great sound of vehement fire.
All night they beat upon the flame of the pyre together,
with shrilling blast; and all night did swift Achilles,
the two-handled cup in his hand, draw wine from
a golden bowl, and poured it upon the earth, and
soaked the ground, calling upon the soul of hapless
Patroklos. As a father weepeth, who is burning the

ghost. They consisted not alone of wine, but of milk, oil, honey
(accompanied, at times, by flowers). Cf. Heliodorus, Aethiopica vi. 301

for the primitive blood-offering) were common: Robertson Smith,

bones of his son, newly wedded, whose untimely death
hath left his wretched parents desolate so wept
Achilles, as he burned his comrade's bones; beside the
pyre slowly paced he, uttering groan upon groan.
But when the morning-star ariseth to herald light
upon earth, in whose wake Dawn, with her saffron
robe¹, is spread over the sea, then the pyre began to
wane, the flame died, and the winds drew home again
over the Thracian deep; which roared beneath them,
swelling with all its billows. Then the son of Peleus
turned from the burning, and lay down weary, and
sweet sleep fell upon him2.
233.] But Atreus' son and his followers were gather-
ing together; and their loud cries and heavy trampling
awoke Achilles; upright he sat, and thus addressed
them :-
'Son of Atreus, and ye other chieftains of the
Panachaians, first quench all the pyre with ruddy³
wine, far as the might of fire hath gone; then let us
gather the bones of Patroklos, son of Menoitios, well
discerning them; nor are they hard to know, for he lay
in the midst of the fire, while the rest-horses and men
were burning apart from him, on the verge, con-
fusedly. These place we in a golden urn, closed in

2 The action of the Iliad may be said to end here. What follows
in the rest of the epic is, however, of great importance in producing
that sense of repose, that pacification of the more violent emotions,
which is required in the highest works of tragic art. Symonds, The
Greek Poets, vol. i, p. 94. A new day begins with line 233.
3 Rutherford, however, asserts that the word does not refer to
colour, but to the effect on the blood of the drinker (=fiery).

grave. No mighty barrow I bid you raise, but just such
as serveth; in days to come, do ye, Achaians, that be left
my survivors in the many-banked ships, make it broad
and lofty.'
249.] Thus he spake, and they obeyed the swift son
of Peleus. First they quenched the burning with ruddy
wine, far as the fire had gone, and the ashes lay deep.
And with tears they gathered the white bones of their
tender friend into a golden urn³, and wrapt them in
a double layer of fat; then placed them in the tent and
covered them with a linen veil. And they rounded off
the grave, and faced the base thereof with stones; then
straightway heaped loose earth upon it; and when they
had heaped the barrow high, they turned home .

2 Quintus Smyrnaeus, in his redundant and iterative fashion,
describes a like office being done for Achilles (iii. 723-9).
3 In Homer and the Tragedians only metal urns were used for the
ashes of the dead (cf. Tennyson's 'two handfuls of white dust | Shut
in an urn of brass '). It may be observed that, contrary to Homeric
practice, inhumation was practised in the Mykenaian period, the
Mykenaian rite being 'Pelasgic,' the Homeric rite Achaian. At the
same time the funeral was not regarded as complete until the ashes had
been collected and inhumed. Thus there was a fusion of two separate
rites, cremation and inhumation.

• The oldest extant Anglo-Saxon poem tells us how Beowulf died,
and how 'the people made ready upon the ground a mighty funeral
pile, hung with helmets and war-shields and gleaming coats of mail,
as he had petitioned. Then the warriors with lamentation laid down
in the midst of it the famous prince, their loved captain; and the princes
began to kindle the greatest of bale-fires on the mound. And the people
wrought a mound on the hill, which was high and broad, visible to
seafarers, and for ten days built up the beacon of the glorious chieftain'

Achilles kept the people where they were, and made
them to sit in wide circle; next from the ships he fetched
prizes,―cauldrons and tripods, horses and mules, choice
head of oxen, well-girdled women, and hoar iron.
262.] First for the swift chariots he set forth prizes;
a woman, deft in all blameless accomplishments, for the
winner to take away, and a tripod with handles, of two
and twenty measures. For the next a mare, six years
old, unbroken, in foal with a mule colt; for the third
a goodly cauldron, on which no fire had passed, bright as
at the first, holding four measures; for the fourth he set
aside two talents of gold', and for the fifth a two-handled
cup, untouched of fire. And he stood upon his feet, and
spake thus in the ears of the Argives :-
'Son of Atreus, and ye other well-greaved Achaians,
behold in the ring lie these prizes, awaiting the racers.
If now we Achaians were holding these games over
another 2, surely I myself would take the first prize and
bear it to my tent; for well ye know how my steeds
excel in swiftness; immortal are they, the gift of
Poseidon himself to my sire Peleus³, who yielded them
to me. But verily I and my firm-hooved steeds will
refrain; so glorious a charioteer have they lost, one so
(Beowulf, chap. xliii). For points of similarity and difference between
the Homeric and the early British barrows, the reader may consult
the late Canon Atkinson's delightful book, Forty Years in a Moorland
Parish.

In the Homeric age the Achaians were still in the 'barter stage.'

oil, and lave them in bright water. For him they stand
and mourn, their manes trailing upon the earth; yea,
they stand with sorrow in their hearts. But do ye others¹
throughout the host make ready, even every Achaian
that putteth his trust in horse and well-knit chariot.'
287.] Thus spake the son of Peleus, and the horsemen
swiftly assembled. First rose up Eumêlos, king of
men, Admetos' loved son, who excelled in horsemanship;
after him stalwart Diomed, son of Tudeus, who brought
under his yoke steeds of the breed of Tros which he had
once taken from Aineias, when Apollo rescued him.
Next after him rose up the son of Atreus, fair-haired
Menelaos, of the seed of Zeus, and brought his swift
steeds beneath the yoke,-Aithê, that was Agamemnon's,
and his own, Podargos. Now Aithê was a gift to
Agamemnon from Echepôlos, son of Anchises, that
he should follow him not to windy Ilion, but enjoy his
ease at home; for Zeus had granted him wealth without
stint, and his dwelling was in Sikuon with its broad
dancing-grounds. This mare, all eager for the race,
Menelaos yoked. Fourth came Antilochos, noble son of
high-hearted Nestor, the son of Neleus, who arrayed his
fair-maned steeds; from Pulos hailed the swift steeds
that drew his car. And his father stood beside him, and

city are considerable, but of the older city the remains are very scanty.

spake for his profit,-a wise man to one that himself had
understanding :-
306.] 'Antilochos, from a child Zeus and Poseidon
have loved thee, and taught thee all manner of horseman-
ship; wherefore there is no need to instruct thee over-
much; for thou knowest well how to wheel about the
turning place; yet are thy horses the slowest in the race;
therefore methinks sorrow will befall thee. Howbeit,
though the steeds of the others be nimbler, yet do not
the drivers themselves surpass thee in craft. Go to
now, my son, and bethink thee of every manner of
device, lest the prize elude thy grasp. Lo, the woodman,
thou knowest well, worketh by skill more featly than by
force; by skill also the helmsman on the wine-dark sea
steereth his swift bark, buffeted by winds; and by skill
charioteer surpasseth charioteer. A chance man, trusting
in his horses and chariot, swerveth thoughtlessly right
and left over a wide field, and his horses wander over
the course, unchecked; but whoso hath wit, though he
drive worse horses, turneth close to the post, his eyes
fixed ever on the goal, and wotteth well how to stretch
his horses at first with bull's-hide reins, and holdeth
them steadfastly, watching the man that is ahead. And
I will show thee a sign ¹, clear to behold, so that thou
canst not miss it. Lo, there standeth a withered stump,
of oak or pine, a fathom's length above ground, by rain
unrotted; on either side thereof are propped two white
stones, at a place where two tracks meet, round which
curveth a smooth and level course; belike it is the monu-
1 i. e. the répua, where the 'turn' in the course was to begin.
2 In almost all parts of the world prehistoric man has left us
stones,-menhir, dolmen, cromlechs,—the purpose of which has been
forgotten. So it seems to be the case here.

ment of a hero dead many a year or a landmark set
there in days of old time; and swift-footed godlike
Achilles hath made it for a goal. Nigh against this bring
thy chariot and horses, as thou drivest, and do thou
thyself lean a little to the left¹ in the well-woven² car;
but the right horse cheer on, and ply the lash, slackening
the reins in thy hands. But let thy left horse graze the
landmark, that so the nave of the well-turned wheel may
seem to touch the surface - no more; see thou strike
not against the stone¹, lest peradventure thou wound the
horses and break the car-a triumph to thy rivals, but
shame to thee. Nay, my son, be wise and wary. For
if, in the race, thou win advantage at the turn, there is
none that shall overtake thee, much less pass thee,-no,
not though he drove divine Arion, swift steed of
Adrastos, which was of heavenly breed, or the goodly
steeds of Laomedon, which throve in this land.'

2 The platform of the car was either of wattle-work, or (as Monro
thinks) of plaited strips of leather. Just above expiµfas means,
literally, crushing against; but the expression is hyperbolical; to 'crush
against' the foot would certainly end in disaster.
3 Homer's meaning is exactly expressed by Horace (Od. 1. i. 4)
'metaque fervidis | evitata rotis.'
4 Cf. Ps. xci. 12, 'lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.'
5 Like Fagin's advice to Bill Sikes, in Oliver Twist, 'be crafty, Bill,
and not too bold.'
6 Arion was fabled to have been gifted with a human voice, and to
have carried Adrastos safely from the field of battle. Cf. Schol. ad

sat down again in his place, since he had told his son
the conclusion of the whole matter.
Then Meriones, fifth in the company, made ready his
fair-maned horses; and they gat them into their chariots,
and cast lots¹. And Achilles shook the helm, and there-
out leaped the lot of Antilochos, Nestor's son; and, after
him, leaped the lot of prince Eumêlos, and, next, that of
spear-famed Menelaos, son of Atreus; and, after him,
that of Meriones. Last came the son of Tudeus, most
valiant of all. They stood in line, while Achilles pointed
out the turning place far off on the level plain; hard by
he posted godlike Phoinix, his father's follower, as
umpire, to observe the running and to make true report.
362.] Then, all together, they lifted their lashes, each
over his two steeds, and smote them with the reins, and
called upon them eagerly; and, undelaying, the horses
bounded over the plain away from the ships, in hot haste;
and beneath their breasts the dust rose and stood, as it
were a cloud or tempest, while the manes streamed out
upon the blasts of wind. Now dipped the chariots to
the rich earth; now rose they into the air; and the
drivers stood firm in the cars, and every heart throbbed
with desire of victory; aloud they called upon their
steeds; and the steeds flew speeding over the plain.
373.] But when at last the swift steeds had attained
the last part of the course, back towards the hoar sea,

the start. The race was only once round the terminal post.

horses strained to their utmost; and then did the swift
mares of Eumêlos shoot rapidly ahead. Close in their
wake drew the stallions of Diomed, the Trojan breed,
and scanty was the room between; for ever seemed
they as if they would mount the car, and the back of
Eumêlos and his broad shoulders were warm with their
breath; over his very body, as on they galloped, they
leaned their heads¹. And now would Diomed have
passed him by or made the race a dead-heat, had not
Phoibos Apollo borne a grudge against the son of
Tudeus, and dashed the gleaming scourge from his
hands. The tears started from his eyes, in wrath to
behold the mares galloping yet the faster, while his
own steeds were checked in their course through lack
of a goad. Howbeit Athena knew that Apollo had
deceived the son of Tudeus, and she sped right hastily
after the shepherd of the folk, and gave him the
scourge, and lent fire to his steeds. Then went she in
high wrath in quest of Admetos' son, and the goddess
brake the yoke of the steeds; and they sprang asunder,
right and left, and the pole was bent to the ground.
And the driver himself was flung from the chariot
beside the wheel; from elbows, mouth, and nostrils the
skin was torn, and his forehead broken above the
brows; his eyes were filled with tears, and his lusty
voice checked. Then did the son of Tudeus, turning
his firm-hooved steeds aside, hold on his way, shooting
far beyond the rest; for Athena put fire in the steeds,
and covered the hero with glory.
Close on his track came the son of Atreus, fair-haired

Menelaos. And Antilochos cried aloud upon the horses
of his sire:-
'On, on! strain with all your might. In no wise do
I bid you strive with yonder horses, the horses of wise-
hearted Diomed, to whom Athena hath now granted
swiftness, and covered their master with glory. But
gain upon the steeds of Menelaos, lest ye lag behind;
go with all swiftness lest Aithê, that is but a mare, pour
shame upon you. Why do ye lag, my bravest? For
this I will tell you, and verily it shall be accomplished:
not at the hand of Nestor, shepherd of the folk, shall
ye have tendance, but straightway he will slay you with
the sharp bronze, if, through your slackness, we forgo
the better prize. Nay, follow hard upon him, and
hasten with all speed; I myself will contrive-for
I shall know how-to head past him in the narrow way;
nor shall I forget.'
417.] Thus he spake, and the horses, awed by their
master's upbraiding, went swifter for a brief space; and
straightway Antilochos, staunch in the fray, beheld
a narrow place in the hollowed track. There was a
dip in the ground, where the winter flood had gathered
and broken away part of the road, and caused all the place
to sink'. That way was Menelaos steering, avoiding
the clash of wheels. But Antilochos, turning aside his
firm-hooved steeds from the way, drove onward; then
1 Roads in antiquity—and not in antiquity only, as travellers in
Spain know well-were little more than watercourses in winter.
Along such a 'gully' the track lay; and whereas Menelaos began to
drive slowly as this gully narrowed (for only one chariot at a time
could pass this danger-point), Antilochos, though adjured by Menelaos,
was determined to drive past, either by compelling his rival to give
way, or by risking a collision.

swerved a little and bore down upon him. And the son
of Atreus cried out in fear:-
'Antilochos, thou drivest madly! go to, hold back
thy steeds (for narrow is the road, but anon it is
broader for passing), lest peradventure thou catch my
car and bring harm to us both.'
429.] He spake, but Antilochos drove yet the faster,
plying the goad, as one that heard not. Far as the
range of a quoit' swung from the shoulder, which
a young man hurleth, making trial of his strength, so far
the horses shot ahead; but the mares of Atreus' son
slackened pace, for he himself of set purpose held them
in, lest haply the firm-hooved steeds should justle in
that narrow place, and overturn the chariots, and the
drivers themselves fall in the dust, in their eagerness
for victory.
Then golden-haired Menelaos, upbraiding him, cried
out:-
'Antilochos, most malicious of mortals, go thy course!
fools were we Achaians to call thee wise; howbeit, not
even thus, without making oath, shalt thou win the
prize.'
441.] With these words he called to his horses in
a loud voice:-

aweary ere yours; for they both are reft of youth'.'
Thus spake Menelaos, and the horses, awed by their
master's chiding, ran the swifter, and speedily gained
upon the horses of Antilochos.
448.] Now the Argives sat in the circle, watching
the chariot as it came whirling dust along the level.
And Idomeneus, prince of the Kretans, was first to
descry the chariot, for he sat outside the circle, high
aloft on a place of vantage; and behold, while the man
was yet afar off, he heard him shouting, and recognized
him; and he spied the gallant steed that led,—bright
bay all over, but on his forehead was a white mark
round like the moon. And Idomeneus stood up, and
spake among the Argives, saying:-
'Friends, leaders and chieftains of the Argives, do
I alone discern horses, or do ye also? Different steeds,
methinks, are in front; and different, too, the driver
that cometh in sight; and the mares, which up to that
point were leading, have been left behind there on the
plain. Them I saw erewhile as they rounded the post,
but now I can in no wise see them; yet mine eyes do
everywhere search the Trojan plain. Maybe the reins
have slipt from the charioteer, so that he cannot drive
aright toward the post, and he hath failed at the turn.
Ha! there methinks he hath tumbled, and broken the
chariot; and the mares have rushed out of the course¹

for I discern not aright; yet surely he is an Aitolian,
and he ruleth among the Argives,-even stout Diomed,
son of horse-taming Tudeus.'
473.] Then did swift Aias, son of Oïleus, round upon
him insultingly :-
'Idomeneus, wherefore hast thou been ever a brag-
gart?? yonder, afar off, the high-stepping mares are
careering over the wide plain. Thou art not youngest³
among the Argives, nor are thine eyes the keenest; yet
wast thou ever a braggart. But ill it becometh thee to
be rash of speech, for there are others here with thee,
thy betters far. The same mares that were foremost
are foremost still, the mares of Eumêlos; and he himself
bestrideth the car, grasping the reins.'
482.] In wrath the Kretan prince thus replied:-
'Aias, master of flout and gibe, in judgement naught, in
all else thou art least among the Argives, because thy
temper is harsh. Come now, let us wager¹ a tripod or
cauldron, and let us both call Agamemnon son of Atreus
to witness which mares be first, that thou mayest know
-to thy cost.'
488.] He spake, and swift Aias, son of Oïleus, was
rising straightway, to answer him wrathfully with bitter
words; and now had contention gone further betwixt

them, had not Achilles himself stood up and cried.
aloud :-
'Dispute ye no more with bitter words, Aias and
Idomeneus; it is unseemly; another, who should do
the like, ye would rebuke. Nay, sit ye in the ring and
watch the chariots; anon the charioteers will be here,
striving after victory; then shall ye know, each one, the
horses of the Argives, which come first, which second.'
499.] Thus spake he; and Diomed drew exceeding
near in the race, swinging ever the lash from his
shoulder; and the horses lifted high their feet as
they galloped nimbly over the plain. And continually
the sprinklings of dust fell upon the driver; and the
chariot, faced with gold and tin, followed hard upon the
quick-footed steeds, nor did the tires cleave any deep
track in the light dust behind; so fast flew the steeds.
There in the midst of the ring stood Diomed, and
plentiful sweat poured from the manes and chests of the
horses to the ground. And he himself leaped to earth
from his glittering car, and leaned the goad against the
yoke. Nor did doughty Sthenelos loiter, but promptly
seized the prize, and gave the woman and the two-
handled tripod¹ to his brave-hearted henchmen to carry
away; then loosed his steeds from under the yoke.

Neleus, drave his horses; for by craft, not swiftness,
had he surpassed Menelaos; yet even so Menelaos

kept his swift steeds close behind. Far as the wheel
is from the horse that draweth master and car over
the plain, straining at full gallop; the hindmost
hairs of his tail just graze the tire', for the wheel
runneth very nigh, and scant is the space between, as
he sweepeth over the open plain: so far was Menelaos
now behind blameless Antilochos. At the first he was
full a quoit's cast in the rear, but swiftly he gained
upon him; for the spirit of Agamemnon's mare, Aithê
of the goodly mane, waxed mighty. And had that
course been but a little farther for the twain, then
surely he had passed the other nor left the race
doubtful. But Meriones, brave henchman of Idomeneus,
was left a good spear's cast behind gallant Menelaos;
for his fair-maned team was tardiest of all, and himself
gentlest of drivers in the ring 2. Last of all came
Admetos' son, dragging his beauteous car and driving
the horses before him. And it was so when swift-
footed godlike Achilles beheld him, he was moved with
compassion, and he rose up among the Argives, and
uttered winged words:-
'Cometh last our bravest, leading his firm-hooved
steeds. Lo, let us give him a prize, even the second, as
is befitting; but let the son of Tudeus bear away the first.'
539.] Thus spake Achilles, and they all assented.
And to Eumêlos would he have given the mare, with
the assent of the Achaians, had not Antilochos, high-

hearted Nestor's son, risen to his feet, and pleaded his
cause before Achilles :-
'Son of Peleus, grievous will mine anger be if thou
bring this word of thine to accomplishment; for thou
art minded to take away my prize, because forsooth his
chariot and swift horses were overthrown-and himself,
too, spite his cunning'. Nay, he should have prayed
to the immortal gods; then would he not have come
last in the race. If thou pitiest him, and he is dear to
thee, surely thou hast abundant gold in thy tent, and
bronze, and sheep, handmaids, too, and firm-hooved
steeds. Of these choose some hereafter, and award yet
a lordlier prize, or even do so this instant, that the
Achaians may praise thee. But the mare I will not
yield; let him lay claim to her who is fain to challenge
me in battle.'
555.] Thus he spake, and swift-footed godlike Achilles
smiled, rejoicing in Antilochos, for he loved his friend.
Then, answering thus, he rejoined with winged
words :-
'Antilochos, if thou indeed wilt have me give
Eumêlos another prize out of mine own store, that too
shall I accomplish. I will give him a breastplate, which
I reft from Asteropaios, a breastplate of bronze, round
which runneth a band of shining tin; a precious thing
will it be for him.'
He ended, and bade Automedon his squire fetch it
from the tent; and went and bare it unto him.
Then in their midst rose Menelaos, chafing in his
mood, for he was full of rage against Antilochos. And

fortune, not by his own fault.

behold a herald put a staff in his hand', and bade the
Argives hold their peace. And thus and thus did the
godlike prince make harangue :-
'Antilochos, once so wise, what is this that thou hast
done? Thou hast brought shame on my skill, and my
horses thou has hindered, thrusting before them thine
own, that were worse by far. Come, then, leaders
and chieftains of the Argives, judge ye between us
indifferently, and favour not, lest any of the bronze-
mailed Achaians should say: "Menelaos, having over-
borne Antilochos with false words, hath departed with
the mare; true, his horses were far worse, but himself
did triumph by reason of his rank and power." Come,
therefore, I myself will declare the right, and none
other, methinks, of the Danaoi will chide me; for just
will my sentence be. Come hither, Antilochos, seed of
heaven, as custom requireth; stand before the horses
and the chariot, and grasp the tapering scourge where-
with thou wert driving aforetime; then lay hand upon
the steeds and swear by the Earth-shaker, him that
compasseth the earth, that not of thine own free will
didst thou foul this my car.'
1 The possession of the herald's staff, or bâton, gave the right to
speak.
2 Viz., as being older: cf. 1. 445.
3 The verdict was to be strictly impartial, that so the umpires might
'truly and indifferently administer justice.' Cf. Deut. i. 16, 17, ‘I
charged your judges, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren
and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the stranger
that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgement; ye shall
hear the small and the great alike.'
* It was the custom (0éµs), when taking an oath, to touch the object
in dispute.
5 Poseidon was the family-god of Antilochos, because the father of
Neleus, from whom he sprang. Naturally he would swear by such
a god.

586.] Then did wise Antilochos make reply:-
'Bear with me now, for I am far younger than thou,
lord Menelaos, and thou art my better in age and
worth. Thou knowest a young man's transgressions,
of what sort they be¹; his wit is nimbler, but slender is
his counsel. Wherefore be patient; verily the mare
I won will I freely give thee; and if thou shouldest ask
yet a greater thing from mine own store, that too
straightway I would fain yield unto thee, seed of
heaven, sooner than forfeit thine esteem, and sin
against the gods'.'
596.] So spake high-hearted Nestor's son, and led
the mare, and gave it into the hands of Menelaos;
and the king's heart was comforted, as the growing corn
by the dew that falleth upon the ears thereof when the
harvest-fields rustle in the wind³: even so, Menelaos,

A drizzle of dark gore splashed over me;
And I rejoiced thereat, as doth the corn
Neath the sweet dews of heaven when the ears
Burst from their sheaths.'

was thy heart comforted within thee. And thus he
answered him, in winged words :-
'Antilochos, now of a truth will I freely lay aside
my anger, since aforetime thou wert not wont to be
flighty nor smitten in mind; but to-day raw youth hath
mastered thee. A second time beware of cozening thy
betters. Not soon would any other Achaian have won
me over. Howbeit, seeing thou hast suffered and toiled
much for my sake ',-thou, and thy good sire, and thy
brother 2 also-I will listen to thy prayer, and will yield
thee the mare (though she be mine), that all men here
may know that never am I haughty and implacable.'
He ended speaking; and gave the mare to Noëmon,
comrade of Antilochos, to lead away; and himself took
the gleaming cauldron.
614.] Then Meriones, fourth in order, even as he came
in fourth, received two talents of gold; but the fifth prize,
a two-handled goblet, was left unclaimed; this Achilles
gave to Nestor, bearing it through the Argive press; and
standing at his side, thus spake he :-
'Take now this, old man, and be it an heirloom unto
thee, to stand as a memorial of the burial of Patroklos;
for him thou wilt see no more among the Argives.
Freely I give thee this prize, and ask no more; for thou
mayest not box, nor wrestle, nor enter for the javelin-
bout, nor run upon thy feet any more; for the burden
of eld lieth heavy upon thee.'

for the prize.

With such words he set the goblet in his hands; and
he took it and was glad; and thus with winged words
he addressed Achilles :-
'My son, verily all thou sayest is meet and right; yea,
no longer now are my limbs firm, as of yore, nor my
feet, nor do my arms swing lightly from my shoulders.
O that I were young and stalwart, as when the Epeians
held funeral rites for royal Amarunkeus, in Bouprasion',
and his sons gave prizes in the king's honour! In that
day no man was my peer, Epeian, or Pylian, or high-
hearted Aitolian. I worsted Klutomêdês, son of Enops,
in boxing; and, in wrestling, Ankaios of Pleuron, who
stood up to face me; Iphiklos, swift of foot, I did outrun ;
Phuleus and Poludôros I vanquished with the spear; in
the chariot-race alone the two sons of Aktor passed me
by; by dint of numbers' they drove ahead of me,-so
yearned they for victory, because the choicest meed still
remained unwon. Twin brethren were they; the one
drave firmly on, aye, firmly; the other plied the lash.
Such was I once; but now let younger men engage in
such like exploits; I must yield to sorry age, though in
other days I shone among the heroes. Now on; do thou
likewise with funeral games honour thy comrade; this

driving the same car' (Paley). But, I confess, this interpretation
seems to me highly problematical; for I do not see what advantage
would accrue in a chariot-race if two drivers happened to be in the
car at the same time and shared the duties; rather the reverse; for
one thing, the horses would have a greater weight to pull. The
difficulties of the passage are, of course, notorious; and Leaf's note
throws no light upon them.

same to Patroklos.

thy gift I gladly accept, and my spirit rejoiceth, because
thou dost ever remember me as thy well-wisher, and art
mindful of the honour due unto me from the Achaians;
for this, may the gods grant thee full recompense.'
651. Thus he spake, and the son of Peleus went his
way through the thronged hosts of Achaia, when he had
heard all the praise of Neleus' son. Next he set forth
prizes, to reward the sturdy boxers. He led and
tethered in the ring a hardy mule, six years old, un-
broken, no stubborner beast to tame; and for the
vanquished he set forth a two-handled cup. Then he
rose up, and bespake the Argives on this wise:-
'Son of Atreus, and ye others, well-greaved Achaians,
we bid two doughty champions come forth and, with
uplifted hands, buffet each other for these prizes; and
let him to whom Apollo' granteth endurance, and whom
all the Achaians deem the better, take this hardy mule
and return victorious to his tent; and the vanquished
shall bear the two-handled cup.'
664.] He spake, and forthwith rose up Epeios, son of
Panopeus, a brave and burly man, a boxer of renown;
and he laid hand upon the hardy mule and cried aloud:-
'Let him come on who will bear away the two-handled
cup! methinks no Achaian will carry off the mule, by
strength of fist, since I boast myself the best. Is it not
enough that I come short in feats of arms? No mortal
wight, I trow, can excel in everything³. Speak I will,

and will make good my words. I will bruise mine adver-
sary utterly, and break his bones; and let his kinsfolk
bide here, each one, to carry him forth subdued by
my hand.'
676.] He ended speaking, and all were silent. Only
Eurualos rose up to meet him,-Eurualos, a godlike
hero, son of King Mekisteus who was the son of Paläos;
erstwhile he came to Thebes, when Oidipous¹ had fallen,
for the burial; there he vanquished all the Kadmeian
race. Him spear-famed Diomed was tending, with com-
fortable words, desiring much his triumph; first he put
a cincture about him, then gave him well-cut thongs' of
wild-bull's hide. So the twain girded themselves, and
stepped into the middle of the lists; then, with sinewy
hands upraised, they fell upon each other, and their
ponderous hands were locked in strife. Grim was the
gnashing of their jaws, while sweat poured on all sides
from their limbs; and godlike Epeios fell upon him, and
smote his adversary on the cheek-bone just when he
peered forth; no long time could he stand, for his
glorious limbs sank under him where he stood.
As when, before a ripple stirred by the North Wind,

wave hideth him again: even so Eurualos leapt up
beneath that blow. But high-hearted Epeios seized

him in his arms, and lifted him up; and his dear comrades
crowded round and bare him through the press with
tottering steps, spitting thick blood, and rolling his head
from side to side; and they brought him, distraught in
mind, and laid him down in their midst; then went
themselves and carried away the two-handled cup.
700.] In the third place the son of Peleus quickly set
down, before the eyes of the Danaoi, other prizes for
the stern wrestling-bout; to the victor he assigned a huge
tripod, to stand upon the fire, priced by the Achaians
at twelve beeves' worth'. For the vanquished he set
a damsel in the ring; accomplished was she in many
a household toil; four beeves her value. Then up
he stood, and spake these words in the ears of the
Argives :-
'Get ye up, all ye that list to win this guerdon.'
Thus he said, and mighty Aias, Telamon's son, arose;
and with him rose crafty Odusseus, deft in all wiles.
Then those twain put on their belts and stepped into the
lists, and gripped each other with stalwart hands and
arms; like two cross-beams of a lofty roofs, dovetailed
by some famous joiner to defy the rude winds. Then did
their backs creak beneath the stubborn strain of bold
hands; a rain of sweat kept pouring down, and thick on
rib and shoulder sprang bloody weals; yet ever strove
they for victory, to win the well-wrought tripod. Neither

could Odusseus trip his rival and bring him to the
ground, nor could Aias; the stubborn strength of
Odusseus held firm. But when at length they began to
tire the patience of the well-greaved Achaians, then did
great Aias, Telamon's son, say unto Odusseus :-
'Heaven-born son of Laërtes, Odusseus, man of many
a wile, do thou lift me-or I will thee¹; the issue shall
belong to Zeus.'
With these words, he sought to lift him; but Odusseus
forgat not his cunning; with sure aim he kicked him in
the hollow of the knee, behind, and bowed his limbs
beneath him; backward fell Aias, and Odusseus fell
upon his breast, while the people beheld and marvelled.
Next in his turn much-enduring godlike Odusseus
sought to lift Aias; and lo, he moved him a little from
the ground, but lift him he could not; yet crooked his
knee, so that the twain fell down close beside each
other, and were soiled with dust. And now a third
time had they sprung up and grappled, but Achilles
himself stood up and stayed them :-
6
Struggle no more, nor weary yourselves with toils.
¹ Apparently each combatant in turn is to offer only a passive resis-
tance, and let his rival try to fling him.
2 Three 'bouts' constituted a wrestling match. 'Apparently the
winner of two falls out of three was to take the prize. In the first
bout Odysseus was clearly successful; the second must have been
won by Ajax, as Achilles, stopping the opponents, gave equal prizes
to each. But why Homer does not make this clear, and why Achilles
did not permit the deciding fall to be contested, is hard to say.
Odysseus was the typical Greek, and possibly the poet shrank from
allowing him ever to be worsted. Or, possibly, the explanation simply
is that the well-greaved Achaians were getting bored with the
performance. Il. xxiii. 721.' (H. E. P. Platt, A Last Ramble in the
Classics, p. 8.)

Victory is for both; take equal' prizes and go your way,
that other Achaians also may try their mettle.'
He spake, and they heard him gladly, and obeyed his
behest; and when they had wiped away the dust they
donned their garments.

740.] And the son of Peleus swiftly set forth the
runners' prize, a silver bowl richly chased; six measures
it held, and in beauty it had no rival in the world, for
skilled Sidonians had wrought upon it featly, and
Phoinician traders had brought it over the misty deep,
and set it up in the harbours, a gift for Thoas. And
Eunêos, son of Ieson, had given it to Patroklos, as
ransom for Lukaon, son of Priam'. This bowl Achilles
offered as a prize in his comrade's honour, for the man
that should prove fleetest of foot. For the second he
offered a bullock, mighty and fat; and a half talent of
gold for the last prize.
Then stood he up, and cried aloud unto the Argives:-
'Up, all ye that list this prize to win!'
754. Thus he spake, and swift Aias, Oïleus' son,
sprang up straightway; and wise-counselling Odusseus ;
and, after him, Antilochos, Nestor's son; for he sur-

2 Under the fostering care of Sidon, Phoinician colonization had
spread over the whole western Mediterranean, and Aegean : and by
her progress in the arts her citizens came to be regarded as the fore-
most artificers in the world. Sidonian metal-work was particularly
in repute. Cf. Rawlinson, Phoenicia, pp. 408-9.-The distinction
between the Sidonians as craftsmen and the Phoinicians as traders
is always kept in Homer.

passed all the young men in speed. These stood in
a line, while Achilles pointed out the goal. From the
start the running was at full speed'; and the son of
Orleus quickly drew away, but divine Odusseus followed
close upon him, near as is the weaver's rod to a well-
girdled housewife's breast when she deftly draweth it
with her hand as she pulleth the spool past the warp,
and holdeth it anigh her breast: so close ran Odusseus,
and trod with his feet upon the footprints of Aias, or ever
the dust could cover them. And ever, as lightly he ran,
godlike Odusseus sent his breath upon the head of Aias;
and all the Achaians roared applause to see him eager
for victory, and they cheered him on as he strove
amain. But when they were coming to the end of the
course, then did Odusseus inly raise a prayer to blue-
eyed Athena:-
'Hearken, O goddess, be gracious unto me; come,
befriend my steps.'
771.] He ended his petition, and Pallas Athena heard,
and made his limbs swift, and his feet and hands above.
And when at length they were quickly about to dart upon
the prize, then Aias slipped in his running (for Athena
baulked him) just where the dung of the slaughtered
beasts was spread abroad, whom swift-footed Achilles
had slain in honour of Patroklos; and lo, his mouth and

"That is, the dust would pour in and obliterate the footprint almost
instantaneously; but Odusseus' foot was down upon his rival's foot-

fact slavishly-as I have no knowledge of the loom. Those who are

the antique) is given of Penelope at her loom (fig. 163, p. 159).

nostrils were filled with dung. Then did much-enduring
godlike Odusseus seize the bowl, as he came in first;
and glorious Aias took the ox. There stood he, grasping
the horn' of the wild ox, spitting out the dung, and spake
among the Argives on this wise :-
'Out upon it! 'twas the goddess baulked me, she who
now, as ever, standeth beside Odusseus, mother-like, and
helpeth him.'
784.] Thus he spake, but they all laughed merrily.
Antilochos bore off the last prize, smiling the while, and
thus addressed the Argives :-
Friends, I speak unto men that know how that, even
to this day, the Immortals honour them that are older.
Aias is mine elder but a little, but Odusseus belongeth
to a former generation, and to them of earlier times.
Folk say he is a hale old man; and it is a hard matter
for any Achaian, save Achilles, to rival him in speed of
foot 2.'
With such words did he flatter the swift-footed son of
Peleus; and thus did Peleus reply :-
'Antilochos, thy praise shall not be spoken in vain;
lo, half a talent more of gold shall I add unto thee.'
So saying, he put it in his hand, and Antilochos took
it rejoicing.
Then the son of Peleus fetched into the lists and

laid down the long-shadowing spear, the buckler and the
helm, even the armour of Sarpedon whereof Patroklos
spoiled him '. Then stood he up, and accosted the
Argives :-
'For these gifts we bid two doughtiest champions don
their harness, grasp the trenchant bronze, and make
trial of each other in the sight of all. And whichever
of the twain be foremost to graze the other's fair skin,
and touch his inward parts, piercing through armour
and dark blood, to him shall I give this silver-studded
sword, well-wrought, of Thracian make, which I took
from Asteropaios³; and let both bear away this mail as
common gear; and we will provide a lordly feast for
them in my tent.'
810.] Thus he spake, and straightway huge Aias,
Telamon's son, arose, and stout Diomed, son of Tudeus
rose to meet him. And when they had harnessed them-
selves on either side of the press the twain met in the
midst, eager to do battle, with grim glances; and amazement
held all the Achaians. But when at length they were come
nigh unto each other, thrice they rushed forward, and
thrice they lunged at each other in close combat. Then
Aias on his adversary's well-orbed shield struck his spear,
yet pierced not his flesh; for the corslet beneath warded
the blow. Meantime the son of Tudeus, ever aiming over
his mighty targe, was like to reach the neck with his
shining spear-point. And it came to pass that the Achaians
trembled greatly for Aias, and bade them cease and

carry off equal prizes. And the hero brought and gave
Diomed a mighty sword, along with a scabbard and well-
wrought baldric.
826.] Next the son of Peleus placed in the midst
a lump of iron, unwrought', which erst the great might
of Eëtion was wont to cast; but divine swift-footed
Achilles slew him, and fetched the iron in his ships,
with other gear. Up stood he, and thus bespake the
Argives :-
'Arise, all ye who are fain to contend for this prize.
Though far from the city lieth the victor's rich demesne,
yet for five circling years will he have it in time of need.
Not for lack of iron will shepherd or ploughman of
his come into the city; this will provide it.'
836.] Thus he spake, and straightway arose Polupoi-
tes, valiant in battle, and the sturdy might of godlike
Leonteus; and Aias, Telamon's son; and divine Epeios.
They took their stand abreast; then divine Epeios laid
hands upon the mass, and whirled, and cast it; and all
the Achaians brake into laughter. Next Leonteus,
scion of Ares, hurled it; and, third in order, mighty
Aias, Telamon's son, flung it from his stalwart hand, and

was familiar with iron as a marketable commodity; if its uses are
restricted, the metal was abundant. On the other hand, the Aegean
civilization (until its decadence) knew, so far as we can at present
ascertain, nothing about the use of iron for weapons or tools. But
Homer lives in an epoch of 'overlap.' See Lang, The World of

he would keep iron in store, instead of buying from the blacksmith).

overcast the marks' of all. But when Polupoites,
valiant in battle, seized the mass, far as a shepherd
casteth his crook whirled flying amid the cattle,-so
far he swung it clean beyond the boundary2; and the
people shouted all. And the comrades of noble
Polupoites rose up, and bare the king's guerdon to the
hollow ships.
850.] Again Achilles set forth for the archers a prize
of dark-blue iron; ten double-axes, and ten single-axes,
set he forth, and far off upon the sand he fixed the
mast of a black-prowed ship, and with a slender string
bound by the foot thereto a trembling dove, bidding
them shoot at her; 'for,' said he, 'whosoever striketh
the trembling dove, let him take home with him all the
double-axes; and whosoever, missing the bird, striketh
the string, shall be deemed the loser, but shall carry
away the single-axes.'
859.] Thus spake he; and up rose the might of
prince Teukros, and with him Meriones, brave hench-
man of Idomeneus. And they took lots, and shook
them in a bronze helm, and the lot of Teukros fell out
foremost. Impetuously he launched a shaft, yet vowed
not to offer unto the king' a glorious hecatomb of
firstling lambs. So he missed the bird, for Apollo
grudged him the prize; howbeit close by her foot he
smote the string, whereby the bird had been bound;
and the sharp arrow severed it in twain. The bird

flew heavenward, and the string dropped loose to earth,
amid the plaudits of the Achaians. Then did Meriones
snatch hastily the bow from the hero's hand; but the
arrow he had ready long before, while Teukros was
aiming¹. Promptly he vowed unto Apollo, the far-
shooter, to offer a glorious hecatomb of firstling lambs.
And lo, he beheld the trembling dove soar beneath the
clouds; there, as she circled round, he smote her in the
midst under the wing, and the shaft pierced clean
through, then fell back to earth, and stuck fast in the
ground before the feet of Meriones. But the bird,
lighting upon the mast of the black-prowed galley, hung
down her head, and her thick plumes drooped 2. From
her limbs sped the swift life, and far from Meriones fell
she; and all the people saw and were astonished.
So Meriones bare away all the ten double-axes, and
Teukros took the single-axes to the hollow ships.
884.] Then the son of Peleus carried and set in the
midst of the assemblage a long-shadowing spear, and
a cauldron whereon fire had never passed, priced at an
ox's worth, and adorned with flowers³; and the spear-
throwers stood up-Agamemnon, wide-ruling son of
Atreus, and by his side Meriones, brave liegeman of
Idomeneus. And thus did swift-footed Achilles accost
them :-
¹ The competitors apparently used the same bow to shoot with.
But the use of ws (=ews) is strange.
2 Cf. Virgil (ut supr.) :—
'Then swift Eurytion looked, and lo, beneath
A darkling cloud, the dove. His arrow sped,
And smote her joyful in the cloudless heaven.
Lifeless she fell, and brought to earth that shaft
Within her fixed; her soul was with the stars.'

'Son of Atreus, well we know how thou dost surpass
all men, and how far thou art pre-eminent in the might
of thy cast; come, do thou take the prize and go thy
way to the hollow ships, and give we the spear to
Meriones the hero, if so thou wilt; for such is my
bidding.'
91
Thus he spake, and Agamemnon, king of men,
hearkened unto his words; to Meriones he gave the
bronze spear, while the chieftain granted to Talthubios
the herald his splendid guerdon.
1 'The most refined of Achilles' attentions is perhaps that shown to
Agamemnon, after the reconciliation, on the occasion of the games.
It was difficult to exclude the chief king from the sport of kings;
inadmissible to let him be worsted; impossible either to make him
conquer those who were his superiors in strength, or to place him in
competition with secondary persons. Achilles avoids all these diffi-
culties by proposing a ninth, or supernumerary, match, with the sling;
and then at once presenting the prize to Agamemnon with the obser-
vation that, as his excellence is known to be paramount, there need be
no actual trial' (Gladstone, Juventus Mundi).

THE RANSOMING OF HEKTOR
Achilles daily drags the corpse of Hektor round the tomb of Patro-
klos; whereupon Apollo appeals to the gods in council, and Zeus
charges Iris to go and rouse Priam to beg the body of his son from
Achilles. Then the god Hermes, disguised as a young prince, offers
to safeguard the king across the plain, till the hut of Achilles be
reached. Achilles receives Priam with honour, and accepts the gifts
for ransom; and the two, Achilles and Priam, sit down to a meal
together. Priam goes back to Troy with Hektor's body, which, after
being mourned over, first by his wife and mother and by Helen and
then by all the Trojans, is duly buried.
And

they took thought of food and sweet sleep, to joy therein;
but Achilles ceased not to weep, mindful of his dear
comrade; nor did sleep, all-subduing, lay hold on him;
but ever would he keep turning, this side and that, as
he yearned after the manhood and brave spirit of Pa-
troklos, thinking the while how many toils he had, with
him, accomplished, how many the sorrows he had en-
dured-wars of men, aye, and the grievous waves he had
breasted ¹!
And, as he mused thereon, tears, unbidden, would fall,
even as he lay now on his side, now on his back, now upon

his face'; till, at length, up he would rise and pace, to and
fro, distraught, upon the seashore. Nor would he be
unaware of the Dawn lightening over beach and sea;
but whensoever he yoked his steeds, then would he fasten
Hektor behind his chariot-seat, to drag him after; and
when thrice round the grave of Patroklos he had drawn
the corse, again would he pause within his hut, while
Hektor he would suffer to lie, stretched and prone, in the
dust. Howbeit Apollo, pitying the dead, kept all de-
filement from his flesh 2.
22.] Thus would Achilles, in his fury, shamefully
entreat Hektor. But, when they beheld it, the blessed
gods had compassion upon him, and oft-times urged the
Swift Appearer, keen of vision, to steal the body. And
this thing pleased all, save only Hera, and Poseidon, and
Athena the bright-eyed maid; these would bide, un-
changed of mood, even as, at the first, sacred Ilion grew
hateful in their sight, and Priam, and Alexandros' folk,
by reason of his infatuate folly. But when, at last, the
twelfth day dawned therefrom, then, I trow, did Phoibos
speak unto the Immortals :-
'O hard of heart are ye, full of bane! was not Hektor
wont, aforetime, to offer up unto you the flesh of bulls
and goats without blemish? Him, now, albeit he is dead,
ye endured not to bring safe home, for his wife, aye
and his mother, and his son, and Priam his sire, and his
own folk, to gaze upon, who would swiftly burn him.

thoughts within him are unrighteous, neither may he be
turned from his purpose, but, lion-wise, he is cruel of
mind. For even as a lion', methinks, yielding to his
mighty strength and pride of heart, goeth against the
flocks, to banquet thereon; so hath Achilles destroyed
ruth, nor dwelleth reverence within him. Doubtless a
man may well have lost some other, even dearer than
Patroklos,—a brother, or, it may be, a son; notwithstand-
ing, after due tribute of tears-some word of woe-he
putteth sorrow from him; for Fate hath granted unto
men a patient heart. Not so Achilles! He hath robbed
godlike Hektor of life; and now, fastening him to his car,
must needs drag him round the grave of his beloved.
Howbeit that thing, be sure, maketh not unto his honour.
Let him see to it that we be not incensed against him,
brave though he be; for surely he doth despite unto
senseless clay.'
55.] Him, in sore wrath, did fair-armed Hera address:-
"Even so might thy words hold good, Lord of the silver
bow, if indeed ye gods mean to set like honour on Achilles
as on Hektor! Hektor was but mere mortal, and sucked
a woman's breast, whereas Achilles is offspring of a god-
dess, one whom I myself nursed and reared, and gave as
bride to Peleus, a man greatly loved by the Immortals 2.
At his bridal, O ye gods, ye were present all; and among

ancient poetry. See e. g. Pindar (3rd, 4th, and 5th Nemeans; and 8th

them, thou, too, didst feast, harp in hand,—comrade of
base men, faithless ever, thou!'
64.] But unto her Zeus, cloud-gatherer, spake in
reply:-
'Hera, be not utterly wrath with the gods! for the
twain shall not have equal honour. And yet unto the
gods Hektor was dearest of all men that be in Ilion. So
he was to me, at least, seeing that in no wise failed he
ever of his gifts. Never did altar of mine lack abundant
feast-libation or steam of sacrifice; truly that honour
did we win. But, in sooth, this theft of bold Hektor's
corse will we waive-without Achilles' knowledge it is in
no way possible, for, well I wot, ever cometh his mother
to his side, night and day alike. Yet I would some one
of the gods might hail Thetis close to me, that I might
speak a wise word in her ear, that so Achilles might
accept gifts from Priam, and let Hektor go!'
So spake he, and storm-swift Iris sprang forth to bear
that message, and, midway 'twixt Samos¹ and Imbros
with its rugged cliffs, she leapt into the dark sea; and
loud echoed the wave above her. And she sped to the
depths like a lead set upon an ox-horn that goeth down
bringing death to ravening fishes. And within a hollow
cave found she Thetis, and round her sat the other ocean
goddesses, gathered all together; but Thetis in their
midst was bewailing the fate of her blameless son, whose
doom it was to perish in fertile Troy, far from his native
land. And standing near, swift-footed Iris accosted her:—
'Arise, Thetis ; Zeus, master of eternal counsels,
calleth thee.'

Her, then, silver-footed Thetis answered :—
'Why doth that mighty god bid me go? I fear me to
mix with immortals; and the sorrows of my heart are
without end. Howbeit I will go, nor shall the word
that he speaketh be in vain.'
93.] This said, the bright goddess took a dark veil ;
raiment blacker than this was not to be found. And
forth she stept, and wind-swift Iris led the way; and
before them twain, I ween, the sea wave parted. And
when they had touched the shore, they sped them heaven-
wards, and found far-seeing Zeus, while all around were
gathered, in session, the ever-blessed gods. Then sat
she down by the side of father Zeus, and Athena gave
place. And into her hands did Hera place a fair golden
chalice, and cheered her with gladdening words; and
when she had drunk thereof Thetis gave back the cup.
And the Father of men and gods spake before them on
this wise :-
'To Olumpos hast thou come, Thetis, deeply vexed,
cherishing wild sorrow within thine heart. I, too, know
it well! Howbeit, I will tell thee wherefore I bade thee
hither. For nine days now hath there been among the
Immortals a quarrel over Hektor's corse, and over Achilles
that layeth cities waste; and some urge that the Swift
Appearer, keen-sighted one, should steal the body; but
I the following solace accord unto Achilles,-to his honour,
-that so hereafter I may keep thy reverence and love.
Go thou, very swiftly, unto the host, and lay on thy son
this charge tell him that the gods are displeased; and
that I, most of all the Immortals, am wroth, in that, with
maddened heart, he keepeth Hektor hard by the beaked
ships, and gave not up the body,-if haply he will fear me
and let Hektor go. Meantime, unto great-hearted Priam

will I send Iris, bidding him go to the Achaian ships and
ransom his son, and bear gifts unto Achilles whereby to
soften his heart.'
120.] Sospake he, nor did Thetis, silver-footed goddess,
disobey, but from the heights of Olumpos sped in haste.
To her son's tent went she; and there found him weeping
sorely; but all about him his comrades were swiftly en-
gaged in making ready their morning meal; and in the
hut had they got them slain a goodly sheep, full-fleeced.
Quite near him his lady mother sat, and fondled him with
her hand; and she spake and hailed him :-
'My child, how long, amid grief and lamentation, wilt
thou eat out thine heart, nowhit mindful of food nor rest?¹
yet 'tis well to lie with a woman, in bond of love. For
long thou hast not to live; but, of a surety, even now
Death standeth anigh, and strong-handed Fate. Yet
hearken to me quickly; surely am I Zeus's messenger.
He telleth thee that the gods are displeased; and that
he, most of all the Immortals, is wroth, in that thou, with
maddened heart, keepest Hektor hard by the beaked
ships, and gavest not up the body. But go to, now, set
him free, and accept ransom for the dead.'
And to her swift-footed Achilles made reply :-
Be it so he that bringeth ransom may take the
dead,-if peradventure with heart's intent the Lord of
Olumpos himself enjoineth it.'
141.] Thus, where the ships were assembled, did
mother and son speak many a winged word to each other.
But the son of Kronos urged Iris forth unto sacred Ilion:-
'Go thou, swift Iris; leave the abode of Olumpos, and,
entering Ilion, bid great-souled Priam fare forth unto

why is thy heart grieved?'

the Achaian ships, and ransom his dear son, and bear
gifts unto Achilles whereby to soften his heart. But let
him go alone, nor let any other of the Trojans accompany
him. Only an aged herald may follow him, to guide the
mules and smooth-wheeled car, aye, and bring the corse
back to the city-even the corse of him that godlike Achilles
slew. Let not thought of death, nor terror, in anywise
trouble him,—so trusty an escort shall we lend him in the
Swift Appearer, who will guide him till he bring him into
the presence of Achilles. But when he shall have brought
the king within Achilles' tent, Achilles will not himself
slay the king, but keep all others in check; for he is not
witless, nor thoughtless, nor malicious, but right gener-
ously will he spare a suppliant.'
159.] So spake he, and storm-swift Iris arose to do his
bidding. Then went she to Priam's home, and found
therein crying and lamentation. The sons, sitting round
their father within the hall, were bedewing their garments
with tears; but he, the old man, there, in the midst, sat
huddled in his cloak¹; and plenteous mire was upon that
old man's head and neck, which he had cast upon himself
as he grovelled there. But his daughters and daughters-
in-law went wailing, remembering them, the many and
the brave, who had lost their lives at Argive hands, and
now lay dead. And the messenger of Zeus stood at the
king's side, and, in a still small voice, spake unto him;
and fear seized upon Priam :-
Be of good comfort, Priam, nor fear thou at all; for
verily I come not now with evil presage, but with good

intent. I am the messenger of Zeus, who, though he
dwelleth afar, yet greatly careth for, and pitieth, thee.
He biddeth thee ransom godlike Hektor, and bring gifts
to Achilles whereby to soften his heart; but thou must
go alone, nor may any other of the Trojans accompany
thee. Only an aged herald may follow thee, to guide
the mules and smooth-wheeled car, aye and bring the
corse back to the city,-even the corse of him that
godlike Achilles slew '.'
188.] Then did swift-footed Iris, having thus spoken,
depart; but Priam commanded his sons that they
should make ready his smooth-wheeled mule-car, and
bind the basket 2 thereon. But himself went down to
a fragrant room, wrought of cedar, high-roofed, which
held abundant treasure ³. Then summoned he Hekabe
unto him, and spake to her :-
"
Alas, poor soul, from Zeus hath come unto me an
Olympian messenger, bidding me go to the Achaean
ships and ransom my dear son, and bear gifts to Achilles
whereby to soften his heart. But go to, tell me this-
what seemeth to be the thought in thine heart? for
mightily do heart and spirit of mine constrain me to
go thither to the ships, within the wide Achaean host.'
So spake he; but aloud his wife shrieked, and answered :
-Ah me, where is thine understanding fled, for which
aforetime thou wert famous even among stranger folk,
as well as among them over whom thou art king?
How wilt thou go, alone to the Achaian ships, into

the presence of a man who hath surely robbed thee of
many noble sons? Verily an iron heart hast thou!
For if he get thee in his grip and cast his eyes upon
thee, bloodthirsty and faithless that he is, no pity
will he show thee, nor reverence thee one whit. But
now let us weep, apart, sitting in the palace. For him
did mighty Fate weave thus, aforetime,-aye at the begin-
ning, what time I bare him,—even that he should become
the
prey of swift dogs, far from his parents, at the hands
of a mighty man whose heart within him would I might
fasten upon and devour! Then might the work of ven-
geance for my son be accomplished, seeing he died no
craven's death, no! but met the stroke standing full in
face of Trojan men and deep-bosomed Trojan women,
without a thought either of fear or of escape ¹.
216.] But to her again spake the old man, godlike
Priam:-
6
-
Stay me not-for I am fain to go-nor be thou thyself,
I pray, a bird of evil presage in the palace. Not that
thou wilt persuade me! Nay, did any mortal man lay
this charge upon me-be he divining seer or priest—then
should I deem it a lie, and fain would hold aloof; but
now (for I mine own self have heard the god, and seen him,
face to face) go I shall, and my word shall not be in vain.
And if it be my destiny to die hard by the ships of the
bronze-mailed Achaians, I would have it so 2: aye,
Achilles may slay me, straightway, once I have taken my
son to my arms,-so I might put from me my desire for
lament!'

228.] He spake, and opened the beauteous lids of his
treasure-chests, whence took he twelve fair robes ', and
twelve cloaks, worn single; and coverlets twelve; and
twelve white linen garments; and as many doublets, to
add thereto. Two gleaming tripods also drew he forth,
and four cauldrons, and a goblet very goodly to behold,
which the men of Thrace had given him what time he
went upon an embassage,—a costly possession. Even this
gift the old man, there, in his palace, spared not; so eager
Iwas he to ransom his dear son. But the Trojans, all,
drave he from the colonnade, chiding them with words of
rebuke:-
-
'Get ye hence, ye that are my dishonour and my shame!
Have ye no mourning to make in your own homes, that
ye are come to vex me? Make ye scorn of it, that Zeus
hath laid upon me bitter grief, even the death of my
noblest son? Notwithstanding, ye shall know what this
meaneth; for verily, now he is dead, shall ye prove an
easier prey unto the Achaeans. But, as for me, or ever
with these eyes I behold the city sacked and ravaged, may
go down even unto the grave!'
I
246.] He spake, and with his staff drave the men
before him; and they hied them forth before the old man
in his haste. Then called he to his sons, rebuking He-
lenos and Paris and godlike Agathon, and Pammon, and
Antiphonos, and Polites brave in battle, and Deiphobos
and Hippothoos, and noble Dios. These nine he hailed,
and gave command thereunto :-
-
'Now speed ye, evil sons that ye are, and my shame!

could make use of such robes as presents to his women captives.

Would ye had all been slain at the swift ships, in Hektor's
stead! All unblest am I, in that I begat right noble sons
in spacious Troy, not one of whom is left',-Mestor, the
godlike; and Troilos rejoicing in his steeds; and Hektor,
who was a god among men, nor seemed he son of mortal,
but of some god. Some hath Ares slain, but here are left
unto me my shames,-deceivers, light-footed heroes,
doughtiest in the dance; plunderers, they, of the lambs
and goats of their fellow demesmen! Go then; make
ready, with all speed, my car; and lay all these things
thereon, that we may accomplish our journey.'
265.] So spake he; but they, I ween, fearing their
father's voice, brought out the smooth-wheeled mule-
car, fair, newly built; and bound the basket thereon.
From its peg took they the mule-yoke, fitted with boss
and wrought all of box-wood, and duly furnished with
rings 2; also, along with the yoke, they brought out the
trace, nine cubits in length; this fixed they firmly to the
polished chariot-pole, even at the turn³ thereof, and with
three twists of the rope on each side they bound the turn
to the boss; then did they fasten it back to the rail of the
car, and turned down the end beneath a hook. Then did
they, bringing from the room countless ransom for Hektor,
heap it high on the polished car, yoking the strong-hoofed
harness-mules, which aforetime the Mysians gave as
splendid gifts unto Priam. Then brought they under
yoke the steeds, which the aged Priam, keeping for his
own use, did feed at the polished manger.
281.] Now while they twain, Priam and his herald,
devising wise counsels, were getting the steeds yoked in

the high-roofed halls, Hekabe, with troubled heart, drew
nigh unto them, in her right hand bearing honey-sweet
wine, in a golden goblet, to the end that they might offer
a libation ere they went. Before the steeds she stood,
and spake, and called her husband by name :—
'There! pour thou unto Zeus a libation; and pray
for a safe return from the hands of cruel foemen, seeing,
I trow, that thine heart doth urge thee toward their ships
-though sorely against my will. But, whether or no,
pray thou at least to Kronos's dark-clouded son, lord of
Ida, who surveyeth all Troy; beseeching him to send
forth a speedy messenger-that bird he loveth best and
that excelleth in strength; pray that it appear on the
right hand, to the intent that thou, having with thine
eyes beheld, may go forth, in full assurance, to the ships
of the swift-horsed Danaoi. But if, of a truth, far-seeing
Zeus grant thee not his messenger, then never would I,
hereafter, urge thee forth unto the Argive ships, whate'er
thine eagerness.'
299.] Unto her did godlike Priam make reply :—
Wife, surely, if thou counsel me to do this thing, I
shall not disobey; for 'tis good to lift hands of prayer to
Zeus, if, so be, he may have mercy.'
He spake, and the old man bade a dame of the house, that
was in attendance, to pour upon his hands pure water;
and she stood by, in attendance, with basin and ewer.
And when he had ceased washing, he received from his
wife a goblet; then, as he stood in the midst of the court,
he prayed, and poured wine forth, with a glance to heaven,
and lifted up his voice and spake :—
'O Father, Zeus, ruling from Ida, most mighty, most
glorious, grant me to find favour and pity in the house of
Achilles, and send forth—a swift messenger-that bird

thou lovest best and that excelleth in strength, on the
right hand, to the intent that I, having with mine eyes
beheld, may go forth, in full assurance, to the ships of
the swift-horsed Danaoi.'
314.] Thus spake he, in supplication; and wise-
counselling Zeus heard him, and straightway sent an
eagle, surest omen among wingèd fowl, that dusk-hued
hunter which men call also the Tawny Eagle. Wide as be
the doors, with bolts well fitted, that grace some rich
man's high-roofed chamber, so wide, methinks, stretched
that bird's wings, either side; and swiftly speeding through
the city, it rose upon the right. And when they had
sight thereof, they were glad; and the heart within.
them was cheered.
322.] But he, the old man, hasting forth, mounted his
polished car, and drave it forth from the gateway and the
echoing colonnade. In front went the mules, dragging
a four-wheeled cart; them did wise Idaios guide; but
behind were the horses, which the old man guiding with
his lash, urged swiftly thro' the city. And with him followed
all his friends, deeply bewailing him as though he were
going to his death. But when they were come down from
the city, and had reached the plain, they, forsooth,-to
wit, his sons and sons-in-law-returned unto Ilion; how-
beit the twain scaped not the eye of far-seeing Zeus, as
they showed themselves upon the plain. He saw, and
pitied the aged sire; and swiftly addressed he Hermes,
his dear son :—
·
'Hermes, surely 'tis thy dearest joy to serve as comrade
to a man; and art wont to give ear to whom thou wilt.
Go to, speed thee, and so bring Priam unto the Achaians'
hollow ships, that none of those others, the Danaoi, may

get sight or knowledge of thee¹, or ever thou come to
where Achilles dwelleth.'
339.] So spake he, nor did the Runner, swift-appearing
one, disobey. Straightway bound he 'neath his feet fair
sandals, divinely wrought of gold, which bare him over
sea and boundless land, swift as the wind. And he chose
him out a staff, wherewith he soothes the eyes of men,
as he listeth, while others again even from their slumbers
he awakeneth; so armed, forth sped he, the mighty Swift
Appearer. Quickly came he to Troy 2 and the Hellespont,
moving on his way in semblance of a young prince with the
first down upon his chin,-one whose youth is right comely.
349.] Now when they had driven past the mighty tomb
of Ilos, then halted they their mules and steeds, at the
river-marge, to the end that they might drink; for verily
darkness had shrouded the land. And when the herald
saw Hermes close by, he was ware thereof, and spake
unto Priam, and hailed him :-
'Consider, thou son of Dardanos; here is matter for
a wary mind. Behold, yonder, a warrior; and speedily,
I trow, will he tear us in pieces. But go to, now, let us
escape in the chariot, or else clasp his knees and suppli-
cate him, if haply he may have pity.'
358.] So spake he; and the mind of the old man was
confused, and terribly was he afraid; and his hair rose
up upon his bent limbs, and he stood amazed. But
Hermes, Luck-bringer, came near of himself; and, taking
the old man's hand, he questioned and spake unto him :-
'Which way, my lord, dost thou guide thy horses and
mules thus thro' sweet-scented night, when all men else
are asleep? didst not even thou fear the Achaians, who,

thy foemen and implacable, are hard anigh thee, breathing
out fury? Whereof if any should behold thee, bearing
so many choice gifts thro' the dark swift night, what then
should thy counsel be? Thyself art not young; and
stricken in years is he that companioneth thee,-too old,
methinks, for self-defence, should any man seek to engage
in quarrel. Howbeit, I shall in no wise harm thee,-nay,
am like to fend another from thee; for surely thou art
like my own dear sire.'
372.] Him, then, did the old man, godlike Priam,
answer:
'My son, 'tis, methinks, as thou sayest. Yet still, even
over me, doth some divinity hold his hand, seeing that
he hath sent, to meet me, a wayfarer such as thou art, in
peaceful guise¹; in that thou, in face and form, art so
noble, and wise of heart, happy are they that call thee son.'
Him then answered the Runner, swift-appearing one:—
"
Of a truth, my lord, all these words thou hast said are
fitting. But come, tell me this, and speak soothly: art
thou sending forth many goodly treasures somewhither
unto stranger folk, that these thy treasures may abide in
safety; or are ye all now abandoning sacred Troy? So
dire a loss is the loss of that bravest of all,―thy son; for
never did he flinch from the battle against the Achaians.'
386.] Then answered him the old man, godlike Priam:-
"
But who art thou, noble Sir, and who be thy parents?
how tenderly hast thou spoken unto me of my ill-fated
son's doom!'
Then spake the Runner, swift-appearing one, unto him
again :-
'Thou dost ask me of godlike Hektor, but to test me.
Oft-times have I seen him in the glorious fray, aye and

when, beside the ships, he drave the Achaians before
him, slaying them with his keen-edged sword, while we
stood by in wonder; for Achilles suffered us not to fight,
wroth as he was with Atreus' son. I was his henchman;
one stout ship brought us both to Troy; of the Murmi-
dons am I, and Poluktor is my sire. Wealthy, indeed,
is he, but stricken with years, even as I see thee; six sons
he hath, and I be the seventh. Chosen by lot from among
them was I, and won the cast—even that I should follow
hither. And now plainward am I come forth from the
ships; for, at dawn, will the quick-glancing Achaians set
the battle in array round about the city. Truly they
that sit idle are a-chafe, nor can even the Achaian kings
curb their eagerness for war.'
405.] Then did the old man, godlike Priam, make
reply :-
If indeed thou be Achilles' henchman, come, declare
now unto me nought but the truth: is my son yet beside
the ships, or hath Achilles hewed him in pieces and cast
him forth to his dogs?'
To whom the Runner, swift-appearing one, made
answer :-
'Old king, not yet have dogs, nor birds, devoured him,
but there he lieth still beside Achilles' ship, even as he fell
among the huts; and this is the twelfth day with him as
he lieth there. Yet is his flesh not decayed one whit, nor
is he eaten of worms that prey upon heroes fallen in war.
And though round the tomb of his dear comrade doth
Achilles drag him ruthlessly, whensoever dawn appeareth,
yet he marreth him not; and shouldst thou go to thy
son, thou wouldst see how he lieth, dew-besprent, the gore
washed from his corse; nor is he at all defiled. The
wounds he did receive are closed, each one; for many

there were that plunged their weapons into him. Such
care have the blessed gods for thy son, even though dead
he be, for the love they bare him.'
424.] So spake he, and the old man rejoiced, and thus
replied:-
'Son, right good a thing it is to offer the Immortals,
also, due gifts; for never did my son-if son indeed I ever
had-forget, in his palace home, the gods that dwell upon
Olumpos. Therefore they remembered those gifts for
him, even in the doom of death. But go to, receive now
at my hands a fair goblet, and protect me myself, and be
thou my guide, with the help of heaven, until I come to
the hut of Peleus' son.'
Then did the Runner, swift-appearing one, make
answer :-
"
Sire, thou art fain to make trial of me, that am thy
younger; howbeit thou wilt not persuade me, seeing that
thou urgest me to receive gifts of thine behind Achilles'
back. Him I fear, and him, in my heart, I reverence;
therefore will I rob him not, lest some mischief befall me.
But, as escort unto thee, would I go even unto famous
Argos', duly accompanying thee in hollow ship, or afoot;
nor, I trow, is any man like to scorn, nor do battle with,
thine escort.'
440.] He spake, and mounting upon the car, the
Luck-bringer swiftly seized lash and reins, and a stout
spirit breathed he into both horses and mules. But when
at length they were come to the towers and trench that
were before the ships, the sentinels were busied anew with
the evening meal; then did the Runner, swift-appearing
one, shed sleep upon them all; and straightway he opened

the gates, and shot back the bolts thereof, and brought
Priam within, and the goodly gifts withal upon the wain.
At length they came unto the high-roofed hut of Peleus'
son, which the Murmidons had made of hewn pine-trunks
for their prince; they had roofed it with soft thatch of
reeds, ingathered from the meadows, and round about
had they made for their prince a large courtyard with
stakes close-set. A single bar held-to the door; wrought
of fir it was, and took three men to drive it home, and
other three to open the mighty barrier of the gates; but
Achilles, I ween, could drive it home even unaided. Then
did Hermes, the Luck-bringer, open unto Priam, and
brought inside the famous gifts for swift-footed Peleus'
son; and he dismounted to earth, and aloud he spake :-
460.] 'Sire, know of a truth that I, that have hither
come, am an immortal god, Hermes; for unto thee hath
my father Zeus lent me, to be thine escort. But be sure
I shall hie me back, nor look upon the face of Achilles
('twere not well that mortals should welcome thus an
immortal, face to face); but go thou within, and clasp
Achilles by the knees ¹.'
With such words Hermes sped back to high Olum-
pos but Priam leapt to earth from his chariot, leaving
Idaios behind; and there bided, reining in the steeds
and mules. Straight went the aged sire toward the
house, where Achilles, beloved of Zeus, was sitting. Him
he found there, but his comrades were seated apart;
those two alone, heroic Automedon and Alkimos, Ares'
son, were ministering to him there. 'Twas but a little
while that Achilles, had surceased from his meal, even
from food and drink; and the table was still spread.

Them did tall Priam pass, unnoticed at his entry;
and, standing close by, he put his hands upon Achilles'
knees, and kissed his hands-dread murderous hands,
which had slain so many of his sons. And as when a
grievous curse¹ lighteth upon a man, so that he hath
slain another in his fatherland; anon he cometh to the
land of stranger folk, even to some rich man's home; and
amazement holdeth all as they stare upon him: even so
was Achilles amazed when he looked upon godlike Priam.
And the rest, too, were astonied, and gazed upon one
another.
486.] Then Priam, deeply supplicating, spake thus
unto Achilles 2 :-
Achilles, thou image of the high gods, remember thine
own sire, whose years are as mine,-even upon the fell
highway of old age. And though, well I wot, his neigh-
bours round about torment him, nor is there any near to
keep ruin and destruction at bay; yet, in sooth, when he
-thy sire-heareth that thou livest, he rejoiceth in heart,
and hopeth every day to behold his dear son returning
from Troy. But I, all unblest am I, in that I begat right
noble sons in spacious Troy, not one of whom, I deem, is
left. Fifty I had, when the sons of the Achaians came ;
nineteen came forth from one mother, and the rest my
handmaids bare unto me in my palace. The others fierce
Ares hath laid low in battle; but one there was whose might,
unaided, did protect our city; and him thou didst slay,
but yesterday³, as he was fighting for fatherland—even
1 ǎrn, i.e. the force which impelled him to do the wicked deed.

section of the Iliad.

Hektor. For his sake am I now come unto the Achaian
ships, to ransom him at thy hands; and countless are
the gifts I bring. Nay but, Achilles, reverence the
gods; and remembering thy father, pity me; more
pitiable, far, am I than he; and I have dared what
never yet another mortal man hath dared,—to reach
out my hand to touch the face of him that hath slain
my son.'
507.] So spake he, and moved in Achilles' heart a
longing to bewail his sire. And he touched the old man's
hand, and thrust him gently from him. Then did they
twain, revolving many memories, weep sore,-Priam,
grovelling at Achilles' feet, for Hektor; while Achilles
wept, now for his father, and now again for Patro-
clos. And the cry of them went up through all the
house.
But when at length godlike Achilles had satisfied his
soul with lamentation', he rose straightway from his
seat and raised the old man by the hand, pitying his
hoary head and beard all hoary; and he spake and
addressed him with winged words :-
'Thou hapless man! in sooth thou hast endured many
a sorrow within thy breast. How didst thou brace thy-
self to come-alone-to the Achaian ships, into the
presence of me, that have spoiled and slain many goodly
sons of thine? Verily, thou hast a heart of iron! But
go to, seat thyself now upon my seat; and still, amid all
our grief, will we suffer our sorrows to lie quiet within us;
for what profit is there in chilling tears? Truly, so have
the gods spun the destinies for wretched men, that,
though sorely vexed, they must needs live on; while the

gods themselves are uncumbered with any care¹. In
the threshold of Zeus stand two jars, one filled with all
the ills he allotteth, the other of the good things. Now
whereas to whomsoe'er Zeus, lord of thunder, giveth of
both commingled, such an one is overtaken, anon with
evil, and anon with blessing; him, on the other hand, to
whom Zeus giveth of life's sorrows, he bringeth to scorn;
and a fatal gadfly driveth him over all the goodly earth,
and to and fro he goeth, honoured neither of gods nor men.
Even so to Peleus also the gods gave royal guerdons from
his birth; for among all mankind was his name noised
abroad alike for prosperity and wealth; king he was of
the Murmidons; and him, though a mortal, the gods
dowered with a goddess for his bride. Yet upon him,
too, heaven sent evil, in that there were born to him
within his house no sons to be rulers; but one son only
begat he to an untimely fate. My father, it seems, I may
not tend in his old age, since, far from home, I dwell in
Troy, vexing thee and thy children. And as for thee, old
man, we know by report that thou wert blest in days
gone by; all that Lesbos out to sea,-even Makar's

beginning:-
'The gods, who haunt
The lucid interspace of world and world.'

'Lernedest nat thou in Greke, whan thou were yonge, that in the entree,
or in the celere, of Iupiter, ther ben couched two tonnes; that on is ful
of good, that other is ful of harm?' A similar reminiscence of this
passage in the Iliad occurs in Le Roman de la Rose, 6839 :—
'Jupiter en toute saison
A sor le suel de sa maison,
Ce dit Omers, deus plains tonneaus.’
One might adduce, too, the passage in Ps. lxxv. 8, 'In the hand of the
Lord there is a cup; it is full of mixture.'

abode,-holdeth within its bounds; and Phrygia, far
inland¹; and the boundless Hellespont,-all these (men
say) thou didst excel in wealth and sons alike. But
since the Powers of heaven brought this trouble upon
thee, wars and slaughtering have been round about thy
city continually. Bear up, nor in thy heart mourn
without ceasing; for 'twill avail thee naught to have
gone sorrowing for thy son, nor shalt thou raise him up²;
ere that, thou shalt suffer some other fate ³.'
552.] Then did the old man, godlike Priam, make
answer :-
'Set me not, yet, upon thy seat, fosterling of Zeus,
while Hektor lieth, uncared for, amid the tents; but let
me go, that with mine eyes I may behold him; and do
thou accept the plenteous ransom we bring. Aye, take
thy joy therein, and mayst thou come unto thine own
land, seeing that thou from the first 4 didst spare
me.'
But, with a scowl, swift-footed Achilles spake unto
him :-
Provoke me no more, old man! without thine asking
am I purposed to give up Hektor: did not my mother
that bare me-even Thetis, the sea-king's' daughter-
come on errand from Zeus? Yea, I know thee, Priam
(for naught is hid from me), that some god hath brought
1 Kabúпeрle, lit. higher, as forming part of the table-land of Asia
Minor. By the 'Hellespont' we must understand the Propontis and
at least some part of the Aegean Sea, as well as the channel which is
strictly called Ἑλλήσποντος. Otherwise the epithet ἀπείρων would be
singularly out of place.

would have dared, even in the heyday of his powers, to
come unto the host; thou couldst not escape the guards,
nor lightly thrust back the bolt that bolteth our gates.
Wherefore rouse not now, I pray, mine anger amid my
griefs, lest I spare not even thee thyself-here, in the
hut-suppliant though thou be; and so I sin against the
commandment of Zeus'.'
571.] So spake he; and the old man feared, and
hearkened unto his word. Then did Peleus' son spring,
lion-like, from the door of his dwelling, not unaccom-
panied; with him followed two squires, heroic Auto-
medon and Alkimos, whom Achilles, I trow, honoured
best of all his comrades, after the dead Patroklos.
From under the yoke then loosed they both steeds and
mules; then brought the herald, that companioned the
aged king, within, and set him upon a couch; and from
the goodly-felloed wain they took the uncounted ransom
for Hektor's corse. Two robes and a well-spun doublet
left they upon the wain, that so Achilles might shroud
the body ere he yielded it up for the homeward journey.
And he summoned his handmaids, and bade them wash
and anoint the body, so soon as he had taken it apart ³,
that Priam might not behold his son,-fearing lest the
old man, when he had beheld, should, in the anguish of
his soul, give rein unto his wrath, and the fury of Achilles
be aroused.
Then, what time his handmaids had washed and

anointed the body, and round it cast both robe and
doublet, Achilles lifted it with his own hands and placed
it upon a bier, and his comrades helped carry it to the
well-polished wain. Then, I ween, he groaned aloud, and
called his beloved companion by name :-
1
'Vex not thine heart, Patroklos, if haply, in that
Underworld, thou have tidings ¹ that I yielded up godlike
Hektor unto his father,—since no unworthy ransom gave
he to me.
Howbeit of these also shall I render unto thee
2
a share, even what things soever are thy due.'
596.] He spake; and godlike Achilles returned unto
his hut, and sat him upon a divan, richly-dight, whence
he had risen,—there, by the opposite wall; and he made
address unto Priam :-
'Know, my lord, that thy son is set free indeed, even
as thou commandedst, and lieth upon a bier; at break of
day thou mayst look upon him, when thou takest him to
the city; but, this hour, let us bethink us of food. For,
in truth, even fair-haired Niobe forgat not food, though
she lost twelve children in her home, six daughters, and
six sons in the bloom of youth. These did Apollo,
incensed with Niobe, slay with his silver bow; and those
1 This was one of those questions on which the general Greek mind
was in a state of uncertainty and hesitation; yet the practical answers
given amounted, for the most part, to an affirmation. Cf. e. g. Pindar,

In addition to those already burnt on the pyre.

has a scornful epigram on this passage, Anth. Pal. x. 47. Quintus
Smyrnaeus also has an interesting reference to the Niobe incident (i.
294 sqq.); compare Glover, Life and Letters in the Fourth Century,
p. 82. The slaying of the Niobids is admirably depicted on a red-
figured vase from Ovieto (now in the Louvre), c. 450 B.C. The legend,
indeed, both in art and literature, was a peculiarly favourite one in

did Artemis, huntress queen, because Niobe, forsooth,
would make herself equal unto fair-cheeked Leto. Leto,
she said, was mother of twain, but herself had borne
many. So they, twain though they were, slew them all.
Nine days they lay in their blood, nor was there any to
Dury them; for the son of Kronos had turned the folk
co stone. But on the tenth day the sons of Heaven gave
them burial. Then did Niobe remember to eat meat,
seeing she was aweary with much crying. And now,
somewhere among the rocks, in the lonely hill-places, in
Sipulos ¹,-where (men say) be the dwellings of the
nymphs that danced about Acheloos 2,-there, turned
to stone by the favour of the gods, she broodeth over her
sorrows. But come, let us, too, take thought of victual,
noble sire; hereafter thou mayst duly mourn thy son,
when thou hast brought him unto Ilion; and verily he
will be mourned with
many tears.'
621.] With these words swift Achilles sprang up, and
slew a white-fleeced sheep; and his comrades flayed it,
and made it ready in seemly fashion; cunningly did
antiquity, and the references to it are numerous (see Paley's note here).
Max Müller regarded it as a sun-myth (cf. Chips from a German Work-
shop, vol. iv, p. 180, new ed.). Chaucer's reference deserves to be quoted
(Troilus and Criseyde, i. 699, 700) :—
-
'To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene,
Whos teres yet in marbel ben y-sene.'
1 For a discussion of this point, see Frazer, Pausanias, vol. iii,
P. 552 sq. For v. 616 (åµp' 'Axeλwïov) see Macrobius (and the Scho-
liast), quoted by Frazer, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 527.
2 A Scholiast on this passage says that the god in Dodona advised
people to sacrifice to Acheloos, the river-deity; and Macrobius, quoting
from the historian Ephorus, tells us that whereas other rivers have but
a local cult, the Acheloos receives universal worship. The Athenians
had a chapel, or shrine, erected in honour of this deity near the Ilissos
(Plato, Phaedr. 230 B).

they divide the flesh into pieces and pierce them with
spits, and cooked them carefully and drew them all from
the fire. Then did Automedon take bread and serve it
upon the table in goodly baskets; but the flesh Achilles
divided. Then did they reach forth hands to the good
cheer spread before them. But when they had satisfied
their desire for meat and drink, verily would Priam
marvel at Achilles, how mighty he was and how goodly
to look upon, for he was like unto the gods before him ;
while Achilles, in turn, would marvel at Priam, gazing
upon his noble mien and listening unto his words.
when they had taken their fill of joy, looking each
upon the other, then that old man, godlike Priam, brake
in and spake unto him :-
But
'Lay me now in bed, thou fosterling of Zeus, with all
speed, that so we may rejoice, lulled to rest 'neath sweet
sleep; for never yet have I closed mine eyes beneath my
eyelids, since the day my son lost his life at thy hands.
Nay, without ceasing do I groan, brooding over sorrows
innumerable as I roll to and fro in the mire within my
courtyard's close. Now, at last, have I tasted food,
and drunk a draught of gleaming wine; till this hour,
verily I had not tasted aught.'
643.] He spake, and Achilles bade his comrades and
handmaidens make ready bedsteads beneath the colon-
nade, and put thereon fair purple rugs, and spread
coverlets above these, and woollen garments to set there-
on, to cover the sleepers withal. Then passed the hand-
maidens from the room, torch in hand each one; and
they hasted, and swiftly spread couches twain. And

swift-footed Achilles addressed Priam, with bitter¹
words :-
'Now lay thee outside, dear my lord, lest haply some
Achaian counsellor make his way hither, one of them
that, sitting by my side, give me wise counsel, as custom
is! Should one of these descry thee thro' the dark swift
night, straightway would he tell it out to Agamemnon,
that shepherd of his folk; and then, belike, there might
be a deferring of the dead man's ransom! But come,
tell me this, and utter it fearlessly for how many days
art thou fain to do funeral rites unto Hektor, that, mean-
time, I may bide here, in person, and hold the host in
check?'
:
Him then did the old man, godlike Priam, answer :—
'If thou art indeed willing that I accomplish burial for
godlike Hektor, thou art like to grant a favour unto me,
by doing on this wise. Well knowest thou that we be
pent within the city, and wood is far to fetch from the
hill, and the Trojans are sore afraid. Fain would we
mourn him in the palace halls for nine days; on the tenth
day would we bury him, and the people feast; on the
eleventh we would heap over him a mound; while on the
twelfth day we can fight, if so we must.'
Then did godlike Achilles, swift of foot, reply:-
'Verily it shall be so, Priam, according to thy word;
for I shall hold the battle in leash, even for so long as thou
commandest.'
671.] With these words, he grasped the old man's
right hand, by the wrist, lest haply he should be afraid.

down to sleep, there, in forecourt ¹ of the house, cherish-
ing in their hearts counsels of wisdom; but Achilles
slept in an inner chamber of his well-fashioned hut, and
by his side lay fair-cheeked Briseis.
All night long the other gods and the warrior host
slept, overcome by soft sleep; but not so Hermes,
bringer of luck; him sleep held not, the while he pon-
dered how to convoy king Priam from the ships, unmarked
of the stalwart guardians of the gate. Then stood he
over Priam's head, and hailed him :—
'Old king, methinks thou, at least, hast no thought of
ill, seeing how thou liest asleep in the midst of foemen,
since Achilles spared thee. And now, though thou hast
ransomed thy dear son, dead, and given many gifts; yet,
for thy life, are the sons thou hast left behind like to pay
ransom thrice as great, if haply Agamemnon and all the
Achaians discover thee.'
689.] Thus he spake; and the old man feared, and
roused the herald. Then did Hermes yoke them their
steeds and mules; and lightly drave he through the host,
and no man knew. But when, at last, they were come
unto the ford of the fair-flowing river 2, then went Hermes
away unto far Olumpos; and Dawn, in saffron amice,
was spread over the whole land. But they twain city-
ward drave their steeds with noise and lamentation,
while the mules bare on the corse. Nor did any, man or
fair-girdled woman, mark them, until Kassandra, fair
as golden Aphrodite, who had mounted the Citadel, was
ware of her sire standing in his chariot, and by his side
the herald that was crier to the town. Him too (I ween)

she saw, the dead one,-there, on the mule-car, lying
upon a bier.
At this, indeed, she shrieked aloud, and cried out
through all the city¹:—
•
Come, O ye Trojans, men and women, and behold
Hektor,—if ever ye rejoiced to behold him returned,
when alive, from battle, in the day when he was, unto
this city and all her folk, a mighty joy.'
So spake she; nor was there any man, no, nor woman,
left within the city; for grief intolerable had seized upon
all; and hard by the gates met they him that brought
home the dead.
Foremost, then, his beloved wife and reverend mother
tore their hair in sorrow for the slain; upon the well-
wheeled train they cast themselves, touching his head;
while round about stood the multitude, weeping. And
methinks they would, pouring forth tears, have bewailed
Hektor before the gates all that day even until sundown,
had not the old man spoken unto the people from his
chariot :-
-
Clear me a way for the mules to pass; then ye may
take your fill of sorrow, what time I have brought him
home.'
718.] So spake he, and they stood aside to make room
for the wain. And when they had brought him to his
famous home, then placed they him upon a couch, richly
inlaid, and by the bier stationed minstrels to lead the
dirges, who sang a dolorous chant,-the men leading the

dirge, while the women wailed in chorus'.
Then, in
their midst, did white-armed Andromache begin the
lament, clasping the head of man-slaying Hektor in her
hands :-
'O Husband-gone from me 2-in thy youth! and
me, a widow, thou leavest in the palace halls! Our child
is but a babe-no more; him we brought into the world,
the curse of fate upon us; nor will he, I think, ever come
to man's estate; ere that, this city will perish utterly.
For thou art gone, who wert the city's very guardian,
thou that wert wont to defend her, and keep safe³ her
noble wives and infant children. No long time hence, it
seems, and they will be a-voyaging in hollow ships, and
I with them. But thou, my child, either wilt follow me
myself where thou art like to be set to tasks of shame *,
labouring for some ungentle chieftain; or else some
Achaian will lay hands upon thee, and in his fury cast
thee down from the rampart (ah, cruel death !)—one
whose brother, belike, or sire, or son, Hektor hath slain;
because, 'neath his mailèd grasp, right many of the
Achaians bit the solid earth, I wot. Surely no weakling
was thy father in battle's grievous fire; wherefore also
the people mourn him throughout the city. O Hektor,

Observe that Andromache, Hekabe, and Helen (as leaders), and the
Trojans (as chorus) now proceed to perform a koµµós for Hektor. The

its reward; (3) his gentleness. See Leaf's note; and cf. Aesch. Choeph.

bitterest woes. For not unto me didst thou stretch out
thine hands from the bed of death; no, nor speak to me
one comfortable ¹ word, for me, weeping night and day,
to cherish in my memory for ever.'
746.] She ended, sobbing, and her women moaned
with her in concert. Then did Hekabe, in their midst,
take up the passionate cry :-
"
Hektor, dearest to my heart, ah! dearest far, of all
my sons, I knew thee in thy life as one beloved of heaven;
and so now, even in the doom of death, heaven is surely
mindful of thee. Other sons of mine hath swift-footed
Achilles sold to be slaves, even whomsoever he took,
across the unharvested sea,-now unto Samos, now
Imbros, and now unto misty 2 Lemnos. But when he
had robbed thee of thy life with sharp two-edged sword,
oft-times would he drag thee round the tomb of his com-
rade Patroklos, whom thou slewest; yet for all this he
raised not again his comrade to life. And now I behold
thee lying in the palace, dew-besprent, and as one that is
newly slain,—like to one that Apollo, lord of the silver
bow, hath visited and slain with painless shafts.'

without end; then, third among them, Helen began the
lament :-
'Hektor, dearest unto me by far of all my brethren,
true it is that Alexandros is my husband who brought
me to Troy (would to God I had died first!). Twenty¹
years have come and gone since I forsook the land of my
fathers; yet never once from thy lips, Hektor, heard
I one harsh or despiteful word; nay, whenever any
within the palace walls reviled me-brother, or sister,
or brothers' wives, aye even thy mother (thy father was
ever gentle)-such an one thou wouldst restrain with
soothing words,-yea, by thy gentle spirit and words of
kindliness. Wherefore I weep both for thee and me, ill-
fated woman that I am, sorrowing in my heart; for
there is none other in spacious Troy gentle, no nor
friendly, and all men shrink from me.'

host groaned in reply. Then that old man, Priam, spake
unto the people :-

fear at all for any cunning2 ambush of the Achaians;
for, of a truth, Achilles, when he gave me safe convoy
from the dark ships, made this promise unto me-not to
mischief or ever the twelfth morn should come.'
Thus he spake, and they yoked kine and mules to
waggons, and swiftly gathered they themselves together
before the city. Nine days were they fetching wood in
plenty; but when at length the tenth morn appeared,
bringing light to mortals, then they carried out bold

an exceeding high pyre, and set fire thereon. And when
the first flush of rosy-fingered dawn appeared, then arose ¹
the people to come unto famous Hektor's pyre.
First with gleaming wine drenched they the pyre all
over, so far as the fire's power had reached; but after-
wards, amid lamentations, his brethren and comrades
gathered the white bones together, while down their
cheeks the tears fell fast. Then did they take and lay
the ashes in a golden casket, when they had wrapped them
in purple coverings soft 2. Swiftly within a hollow
grave they laid them; and, above, they covered them
with mighty stones, close set. Lightly heaped they earth
thereon; and everywhere scouts were set, that the well-
greaved Achaians might not sally forth against them
ere the time. When they had heaped the barrow there,
they hied them back. Last scene of all, they assembled
themselves together and duly held a noble banquet in
the palace of Priam, Zeus-descended king.
So did they busy themselves with the burial of horse-
taming Hektor 3.

ADDITIONAL NOTES TO BOOK XXIV
1-804. As the crowning scene in the Iliad Homer contrives to make
us feel that, after all, Achilles is a man. The wrathful and revengeful
hero... relents in pity at a father's prayer. . . . Begging Patroklos to
forgive him for robbing his ghost of this last satisfaction, he relinquishes
to Priam the body of his son. Yet herein there is nothing sentimental.
Achilles is still the same-swift to anger and haughty—but human
withal, and tender-hearted to the tears of an enemy at his mercy.'
(Symonds, The Greek Poets, vol. ii. 95.)
221. Note the distinction here between priests and seers; the former
are temple-ministrants, the latter advisers, under the inspiration of Apollo,
as god of augury.
266-274. This is a difficult passage, and there is no very satisfactory
solution of the problems involved. Leaf (in his edition of the Iliad,
vol. ii, pp. 623 sqq.) discusses the matter, and the student must refer
to his work. The 'boss' (³µpaλós) was probably on the yoke itself.
Apparently the Téça (or pole end) turned sharply up; it was doubtless
of metal, and perhaps ornamental in shape.
301. Homer seldom expresses the language of praise and thanksgiving
in prayer, such as we find in the Bible; prayers are nearly always petitions
rising to the lips spontaneously in times of difficulty or distress.
308. In spite of the fatherhood of Zeus, on which Homer dwells so
frequently, there is little suggestion in the Homeric poems of any
spiritual relationship between God and man, such as finds expression in
Lactantius' definition of true piety: pietas nihil aliud est quam Dei
parentis agnitio.' (Adam, The Religious Teachers of Greece, p. 48.)
340. This passage (with which cf. Odyss. v. 43) has been imitated by
Virg. Aen. IV. 238 sqq.-
'He spake; and Hermes girded him to speed
The almighty Father's bidding. On his feet
He bound the golden sandals which upbare
Him high aloft, winged with the wind, o'er sea
And land; then took his wand, wherewith he calls
The pallid phantoms from the vasty deep,
Or casts them down to hell; gives sleep, and takes;
And opes the eyes that have been sealed in death.'

448. The Koin or hut is here built on the scale of a large house,
with courtyard, vestibule, verandah, and hall. This indicates a complete
difference of view from almost the whole of the rest of the Iliad. The
conception (says Bayfield) indicates a poet who is more familiar with
the palace than the camp.

527. The ordinary solutions whereby thinkers have tried to reconcile
the existence of pain and sorrow in the world with the moral goodness
and omnipotence of God, are alien from the simple realism of Homer.
In the poet's view Zeus is the dispenser of evil as well as of good.
(Adam, op. cit., p. 36.)

the Tyrian Melkarth.
614-617. Greek mythology contains many legends of such 'meta-
morphosis.' Niobe, weeping for her children, became a rock whence
tears flowed for ever. This was, doubtless, because the rock Niobe, on
Mt. Sipulos, was a divine rock which exuded moisture, and anthropo-
morphism had to invent a reason for its grief. (Cf. Salomon, Orpheus,
chap. iii.) The legend of Lot's wife in the Biblical narrative has points
of resemblance with the Niobe story. See Lang, Myth, Ritual, Religion²,
vol. i, pp. 149-154.

'As Chatham lay on his death-bed looking forward to his
own immediate end, he caused his son to read to him the passage in
Homer describing the stately obsequies of Hektor and the sorrow and
despair of Troy.' (Lecky, History of England in the Eighteenth Cen-
tury, iv. 85.)

APPENDICES
A. THE PICTURE OF ACHILLES IN HOMER
'His irresistible might and splendour in war, his stormy
human passions, his fine sense (fitting in the son of a goddess)
for what is soothing or strengthening in the messages of the
gods, his love passing the love of women, his foresight of an
early death, even when life was most dazzling, made him glow
before the Greek imagination with an immortal youth, as the
very type of chivalry in their race. The early ambitions of
Alexander the Great were fired by this Homeric vision of
Achilles. Nothing can show better how vividly the Homeric
Poems wrought in Greek life and history than to see how
real the young Greek hero at Troy was to the young Greek
conqueror of the East.'-R. C. JEBB, Greek Literature.
B. THE RISE OF THE Iliad
'Somewhere on the Ionian coast or among the adjacent
islands, in a sky sown thick with dust of stars, a great planet
arose. Homer conceived and executed the Iliad. That Iliad,
in its main substance and essential form, is the Iliad which
we possess now. It passed through many vicissitudes. It
suffered one long eclipse or submergence.¹ It received
accretions of substance, some of which at least are not from
the hand of the original author. Its dialectical forms were
modified; in details it was retouched and modernized. But
it remained the same poem. The canonical Iliad issued at
Athens in the sixth century B. C., which is to all intents and
purposes our Iliad, is also to all intents and purposes the
original and only Iliad, the work of Homer.'

THE ILIAD OF HOMER
C.
HOMERIC VIEW OF LIFE
'The Homeric epics were the first-fruits of clear Greek
apprehension of the facts of life and the Greek formative
imagination, whose creations would have been fiction had
they not been art. Throughout the poems the working of
these two faculties is evident and distinguishable. As a fact
appears to Homer he clearly thinks it, nor confuses it in
contradictions. Wisely he reasons, never mistaking wish
for fulfilment, but basing judgement on observation. The
clearness of his apprehension of life issues in truthfulness
of imagination.
'Homer's was not a contemplative age. The wisdom of the
epics is taught by the action of the heroes, the current of the
story, and the outcome of it all. Some clear ethical utterances
are there fitting the occasion, and a few general reflections
are found; but only in the idea of Fate¹ were the experience
and knowledge of the age combined in judgement upon life
of universal application.'
HENRY OSBORNE TAYLOR, Ancient Ideals.
D. THE EXPRESSION OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRUTH
IN HOMER
'In the poems of Homer we have an almost perfect instance
of the way in which objects may be kept as objects within the
forms of the sensuous consciousness, and yet filled with
a meaning which is not sensuous. With Homer, the whole
picture of earth and heaven remains still in the simple
naturalistic form. We never from him hear of anything but
particular objects and events, subject to all the conditions of
space and time. Yet in his hands the actions narrated
somehow get a wider meaning, and become suggestions or
symbols of something more than themselves. The objects
1 It is perhaps significant that Homer uses no less than five words
to express Fate and the personal lot of man—μοῖρα, μόρος, αἶσα, κῆρ,
TÓTμos. These different words at least indicate the complex origin of
the Homeric notion of destiny.

are cleared of accidental elements and so presented that they
are hardly to be thought of except as types, i. e. of particulars
which concentrate in themselves the meaning of a whole
class of objects and events. This instructive selection of the
poet is, in its way, as enlightening as the scientific man's
conscious selection of just those circumstances that throw
light upon a hitherto hidden law of nature.'
EDWARD CAIRD, The Evolution of Religion.
E. SPEECHES IN HOMER
'The naïveté of Homeric society must not lead us to think
of Homer as representing rude and primitive thought.
Homer stands out against a vast background of civilization.
The language itself is in the highest degree developed-
flexible and expressive, with a fine play of particles conveying
delicate shades of feeling and suggestion. Homeric men
are talkative; each passing mood seeks some form of utter-
ance; but garrulous they are not. They wish to speak, but
they have always something to say. They endeavour to
present their case to themselves as it presents itself to the
mind of others. They appeal both to living witnesses and to the
experience of the past; they bring the outer and the inner
world into significant connexion; they enforce their arguments
by sayings containing the condensed wisdom of life. Homeric
discourse, with the marvellous resources of its vocabulary, its
structural coherence, its intimate union of reason and passion,
has in it all the germs of future Greek oratory.'
S. H. BUTCHER, Lectures on Greek Subjects.
F.
ODUSSEUS
'If Achilles be the type of the Hellenic genius, radiant, ado-
lescent, passionate; as it still dazzles us in its artistic beauty
and unrivalled physical energy; Ulysses is no less a true portrait
of the Greek known to us in history-stern in action, ruthless
in his hatred, pitiless in his hostility; subtle, vengeful, cunning;
yet at the same time the most adventurous of men, the most
persuasive in eloquence, the wisest in counsel, the bravest

and coolest in danger. The "Graeculus esuriens" of Juvenal
may be said to be the caricature in real life of the idealized
Ulysses. And what remains to the present day of the Hellenic
genius in the so-called "Greek nation" descends from Ulysses
rather than Achilles. If the Homeric Achilles has the supe-
riority of sculpturesque and dramatic splendour, the Homeric
Ulysses beats him on the ground of permanence of type.'
JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONS, The Greek Poets.
G. HEKTOR COMPARED WITH ACHILLES
'The two persons who throughout the Iliad stand out in
relief and contrast to each other are Hector and Achilles ; and
faith in God (as distinct from a mere recognition of Him) is as
directly the characteristic of Hector as in Achilles it is entirely
absent. Both characters are heroic, but the heroism in them
springs from opposite sources. Both are heroic, because both
are strong; but the strength of one is in himself, and the
strength of the other is in his faith. Achilles is the hero of
the stern, human, self-sufficing spirit, which does not deny or
question destiny, but sees nothing in it but a cold iron law;
meets force with force; and holds up against it an unbroken,
unbending will. Turn to Hector, and we pass from shadow
into sunlight. Achilles is all self, Hector all self-forgetfulness;
Achilles all pride, Hector all modesty. The confidence of
Achilles is in himself and in his own right arm; Hector knows
that there is no strength except from above.
"God's will,"
he says, "is over all; he makes the strong man to fear, and
gives the victory to the weak, if it shall please Him.”
J. A. FROUDE, Short Studies.
H. THE HOMERIC EPOS
'It was the peculiar glory of Greece that, in the earlier stage
of her literary development, she manifested not only a per-
fection of expression and of art, but a maturity of intelligence,
a true insight into the meaning of life, a nobility of imagina-
tion in union with a clearness and sanity of judgement,
which the most advanced eras of other literatures scarcely

equal. Thus the two great Greek epics are unique in
character; and, while they have, in the highest degree, the
excellences of each class, the primitive and the literary epic,
they can properly be ranked under neither. While exhibit-
ing one better than any other writings, man and the out-
ward world in "the first intention,”—man in the energy and
buoyancy of the national youth, and Nature in the vividness
of impression which she makes on the mind and sense in
their most healthy activity,-they are at the same time
masterpieces of art and great monuments of the national
mind. The Greek, imagination, with no appearance of
effort, produced works of such compass and harmonious
proportion as only long years of labour and reflection in
collecting and combining materials in accordance with a pre-
determined purpose produced in other literatures.'
W. Y. SELLAR, Virgil.
HOMERIC MAXIMS
Though subjective and reflective passages are comparatively
rare in Homer-he does not exhibit that 'gnomic' and
sententious vein which we are accustomed to find in Pindar
and Euripides, for example-the Iliad is not destitute of
such passages; and we shall not do amiss to consider
briefly some few of those pithy or proverbial sayings in
which the poet condenses the experience and wisdom of life.

THE ILIAD OF HOMER
SORTES HOMERICAE
The so-called 'sortes Virgilianae'—the custom of inquiring
as to the future by opening at random a copy of Virgil—were
practised not only in the Middle Ages, but even by the Roman
Emperors; powers of prophecy being ascribed to this poet
as well as to the Sibylline Books and to the Bible (cf. Compa-
retti, Virgil in the Middle Ages [E. T. p. 48]). But this practice
was not confined to Virgil; Homer also was consulted for
a like purpose.
There is a curious passage in Rabelais
(Book III, chap. x) which is worth transcribing here¹:-
'By Homeric lots men have often lit upon their Destiny:
Witness Socrates, who, hearing in Prison the Recitation of
this Line of Homer, said of Achilles, Iliad ix. 363,
ἤματί κεν τριτάτῳ Φθίην ἐρίβωλον ἱκοίμην.
I shall arrive, and with no Delay,
In fair and fertile Phthia the third Day,
foresaw that he should die the third Day from then, and thus
assured Aeschines, as Plato records in the Crito, Cicero primo
de Divinatione, and Diogenes Laertius;
Witness Opilius Macrinus, to whom, when eagerly desiring
to know whether he should be Emperor of Rome, befell, by
Chance of the Lot, this sentence, Iliad viii. 102,
ὦ γέρον, ἢ μάλα δή σε νέοι τείρουσι μαχηταί·
σὴ δὲ βίη λέλυται, χαλεπὸν δέ σε γῆρας ὀπάζει,
Old man, these youthful warriors press thee sore,
Thy Vigour spent, oppressed by grievous Eld.
In fact he was already old; and, having held the Empire only
one Year and two Months, he was dispossessed and slain by
Heliogabalus, who was young and powerful;

the Battle of Pharsalia, in which he was killed, stumbled upon
this Verse, said of Patroclus, Iliad xvi. 849,
ἀλλά με μοῖρ᾽ ὀλοὴ καὶ Λητοῦς ἔκτανεν υἱός,
By felon Fate I'm slain, and Leto's son,
that is to say APOLLO, which was the Watchword on the Day
of that Battle.'
THE HOMERIC PANTHEON
For the benefit of readers of the Iliad, who are unfamiliar
with Greek, I append a short list of the chief gods and
goddesses mentioned in the poem.
Zeus¹, son of Kronos, 'king of gods and men,' lord of the
clouds (Keλaivens), of the lightning, of the thunderbolt
(TEρTIKÉрavvos). By easy transitions the Greeks passed from
recognition of Zeus as a sky-god to that of Zeus as a water-
god; and there is ample evidence to show he was regarded
as an earth-god also. Cf. the line in an Orphic hymn, where
the Sun is thus addressed:
ἀγλαὸ Ζεῦ Διόνυσε, πάτερ πόντου, πάτερ αἴης.
In other words, he has a triple aspect, as we see from Iliad
XV. 187 sqq. As Ovid puts it (Metam. xv. 858)
'Iupiter arces
temperat aetherias et mundi regna triformis.'
His tenderness for Thetis, as Campbell notes (Religion in
Greek Literature), forms the hinge on which the action of
the Iliad turns.
Hera, sister and wife of Zeus, patroness of Argos' and Sparta.
See Dr. A. B. Cook's forthcoming work on Zeus, and the same
writer's already published papers (in Folk-Lore) on the 'European
Sky-God.'
2 It may be noted that Argos in Homer denotes two different places:
(1) a watered plain in the Peloponnesus, (2) a watered plain in

THE ILIAD OF HOMER
She takes the Greek side in the war, and is represented
by the poet in no favourable light, inasmuch as she is
a shrew, a scold, and a jealous wife.
Athena, also called Pallas, the daughter of Zeus, whose aegis
she bears. A virgin goddess, she is patroness of art, of
justice, of wisdom, and of war. Her character, weapons,
and cult all point to a northern origin, like that of Zeus and
Apollo (see Murray, Four Stages of Greek Religion, chap. i).
Her chief epithet is yλavкwπis, bright-eyed (though some
would render' owl-eyed'). The person of the goddess has
a curiously divided aspect in the Iliad; her temple stands
upon the citadel of Troy, under the attribute of ‘guardian of
the city'; yet she sides with the Greeks, and supports
Hera.
Apollo (called also Phoibos, god of light, as he is also god of
prophecy and music), the son of Zeus and Leto, lord of the
bow (ἀργυρότοξος, ἑκατηβόλος, ἑκάεργος). He was associated,
in Homeric mythology, with Poseidon, as builder of the
walls of Troy for Laomedon. He is no 'Hellene,' for he
champions Troy and even slays Achilles. As Phoibos
he is a sun-god.
Artemis, 'queen and huntress, chaste and fair,' the sister
of Apollo. She is also, as archer-queen, goddess of the
bow, and is represented as causing sudden death to women.
Poseidon, brother of Zeus, lord of the sea, and also shaker of
the earth (évvoolyaios), the sender of wind and storm. He
acts chiefly as a disturbing force in the poem, rebels against
the bounds which Zeus has set to his restricted sway, and is
rarely found on Olumpos. He is represented as the giver
of the immortal horses to Peleus, and as bearing a grudge
against the Trojans.-Cf. Murray, Four Stages, p. 73.
Hephaistos, the fire-god, son of Zeus and Hera. As the
great craftsman of the gods, he is represented not only as
the heavenly architect (i. 608), but also as the maker of the
Thessaly, Originally Hera seems (so Prof. Murray thinks) to have
belonged to (2).

Shield of Achilles (Book xviii). His lameness is assigned to
a fall from heaven-an obscure point in his legend.
Arês, son of Zeus and Hera; the god of war ('insatiate of
battle,' 'man-destroyer,' ẞporoλolyós). He is the avowed
föe of the Greeks. Zeus, in one passage, speaks of him-
the incarnate spirit of war-as most hateful to him of all the
gods.
Hadês, brother of Zeus, and master of the underworld, which
he shared with his consort Persephonê (as the Babylonian
Nergal shared the rule of the ghost-realm with Allatu).
Hermês, the messenger of the gods, called the 'bright one'
in ii. 103, and (in xxiv. 24, &c.) the 'swift appearer' (åpyeï-
póvrŋs). The allusion to Hermes as a god of theft (in xxiv)
is regarded by many as a mark of the lateness of the book.
The epithet éprouvios, attached to him, is variously explained
as (1) luck-bringer, (2) making the wool to grow (in reference
to his position as a pastoral deity). As to Hermes,' says
Pausanias, 'the poems of Homer have given currency to
the report that he is a servant of Zeus and leads down the
spirits of the dead [as the уʊуожоμлóя] to the nether world.'
Aphroditê, daughter of Zeus, goddess of love and beauty.
She is an ardent champion of the Trojans.
Dionusos, son of Zeus by Semelê (called a 'delight to mortals'
in xiv. 325).
Besides these there are several minor Powers, e.g. Dawn
(Eôs), the Sun (Eëlios), Themis (summoner of the Divine
Council), Thetis (sea-nymph; mother of Achilles), Iris
(the rainbow goddess who acts as the messenger of Zeus),
Eris and Enualios (companions of Ares), Enuo (the war-
goddess), Eilithuia (goddess of childbirth), Demêtêr (earth-
goddess: cf. v. 505, and Lang's Myth Ritual and Religion²,
vol. ii, pp. 280 sqq.), and the Erinues (originally ghosts of
the dead, inflicting punishment mostly in the life on earth.

Jevons, Manual of Greek Antiquities, Book. II, chap. v).

EPILOGUE
As one that pores upon a manuscript
Sallow with age, endeavouring thence to trace
Some half forgotten legend of old time;
The lines indeed are blurred, the margins rent;
Lo, as he strives to piece the fragments out,
A sudden radiance falls, and what seemed dark
Glows like a jewelled chalice, while a world
Of strange, unsummed, and immemorial things
Opens before his eyes, perplext before:
So, from the magic page where lives enshrined
The miracle of Greece, there strikes a gleam
As of the sun new-risen; and we view
Once more the figures of heroic lay
Stand pedestalled in splendour; hear again
The clash of countering armies; mark the flight
Of that doomed Warrior round the Trojan wall
Till, foiled, he sinks; and watch with beating hearts
The 'Wrath' dissolve in tears-an old man's tears.
E. H. B.

The Plays of Aeschylus
Translated from a Revised Text by
Walter Headlam, Litt. D.
And
C. E. S. Headlam, M.A.
'Apart from the high literary value of the translation, the notes represent for
most of the plays all that we can now have of that edition of Aeschylus which
would certainly have formed an important landmark in the history of Aeschylean
scholarship had Dr. Headlam lived to produce it. Slight as they are, these notes
are of the greatest importance, for they represent the study of a lifetime, and no
serious student of Aeschylus can afford to be without them.'-Cambridge Review.
'The work is based on a large and scholarly criticism of the text, and the
meaning is brought out with strenuous fidelity and marked ability.'-Educational
Times.
Gaius
The Poems of
Valerius
Valerius Catullus
With Text and Translation on opposite pages, a short
Sketch of the Times of Catullus, and very full Notes, by
Charles Stuttaford
Bound in Buckram, 6s. net.
'We recommend the book warmly.'-Observer.
'Both Messrs. Bell and Mr. Stuttaford have achieved considerable success.
Mr. Stuttaford's translation is commendably clear and accurate, while he has
added to the value of the book by his lucid notes, a sketch of the Times of Catullus,
and a very excellent explanation of the metres used by Catullus.'--Globe.

Varro on Farming
M. Terenti Varronis Rerum Rusticarum
Libri Tres
Translated, with Introduction, Commentary
and Excursus
By
Lloyd Storr-Best, D.Lit., M.A.
HE translation is preceded by an introduction
ΤΗ
giving information as to the facts of Varro's life
and the circumstances in which the treatise is supposed
to have originated. It contains, moreover, numerous
notes both critical and explanatory in which the trans-
lator suggests various emendations of the sometimes
obscure text which deserve the attention of all scholars
who are interested in this work.
'The author has already secured a Doctorate of Letters from the
University of London for this work. This translation, which is
clear, accurate and admirably equipped with notes, fills a real gap in
classical literature.'-Athenaeum.
'This is far more than a translation. There is an excursus on
the text and proposed emendations and very full notes citing the
authorities that Varro used, parallel passages, and the borrowings of
Virgil and later writers. The work is full of interest for the
Latin scholar and antiquary. . . . The translation is faithful and at
the same time good English.'-Journal of Education.
'An admirable translation.'-Liverpool Courier.
